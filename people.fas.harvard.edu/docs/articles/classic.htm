<H3 CLASS="western">The Classic</H3>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Nearly everyone will
grant that Tocqueville&rsquo;s <I>Democracy in America</I> deserves
to be called a &ldquo;classic.&rdquo; Does the work&rsquo;s classic
status constrain its translator? Should it? And if so how? These are
the questions I want to address.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">What is a &ldquo;classic?&rdquo;
According to the Roman grammarian Aulus Gellius, the classical writer
is one who is &ldquo;not proletarian.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote1anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A></SUP>
<I>Classic</I> thus has to do with class, with classification, with
hierarchy, but the hierarchy in question is social, not literary or
philosophical. The classic is a work by an author of rank. Le comte
Alexis de Tocqueville certainly qualifies on that count. But this
would be a rather literal reading.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Subsequently, however,
the hierarchical connotations of the word were transferred from
author to work. In its primary definition <I>classic</I> means &ldquo;of
the first class, of the highest rank or importance, approved as a
model; standard, leading.&rdquo; Of course there is often
contamination between one form of superiority and another: already in
the <I>Politics</I> Aristotle works hard to keep superiority by
virtue of excellence apart from superiority by virtue of wealth or
social distinction, but he admits that the lines can easily blur, the
categories coalesce. Littr&eacute;, the great French lexicographer of
the nineteenth century who was also a leading Positivist, perhaps
betrays his philosophical allegiance by giving positive concreteness
to the judgment of superiority: the leading works approved as models
are those &ldquo;used in or belonging to the classes of colleges or
schools.&rdquo; <I>Democracy in America </I>certainly qualifies as a
classic in this respect as well. There is probably no work about its
subject more widely assigned in schools.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">The OED also notes a
&ldquo;transference of the epithet from the first-class or standard
writers in Greek and Latin to these languages themselves,&rdquo;
which it attributes in part &ldquo;to the notion that the latter are
intrinsically excellent or of the first order, in comparison with the
modern tongues.&rdquo; Tocqueville of course did not write in the
classical tongues, but we know that between 1835 and 1840 he
consulted not only Plato, Aristotle, and Plutarch but &ldquo;classic&rdquo;
writers of the post-classical tradition such as Aquinas, Machiavelli,
Montaigne, Bacon, Descartes, Pascal, Montesquieu, and Rousseau.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote2anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A></SUP>
We also know how much his early education owed to his tutor, the abb&eacute;
Lesueur. Lesueur, who had also been his father&rsquo;s tutor, was a
man who belonged more to the eighteenth century than to the
nineteenth and who wrote an elegant French in the manner of that
earlier time. When the young Tocqueville won a prize in rhetoric at
the Metz lyc&eacute;e, he credited the preparation received from his
tutor. The good abb&eacute;, moreover, was an ecclesiastic with
Jansenist leanings, who probably imparted the values of that
austerely cerebral sect to his pupil, and we know that Pascal, the
most sparkling of Jansenist writers, remained an important influence
on Tocqueville&rsquo;s thinking.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote3anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote3sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A></SUP>
Thus from his earliest upbringing Tocqueville had his attention
turned from his own time to that earlier period to which the French
refer as <I>l&rsquo;&acirc;ge classique</I>: classic because its
authors were the first, in the opinion of many, to fashion from
French an instrument supple enough to convey ideas and images with
the vigor and subtlety of Latin and Greek, and classic, too, in the
sense of <I>classicizing</I>, harking back to ancient models as
exemplars of the best that had been thought and known.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Unlike his uncle
Chateaubriand, the proto-Romantic <I>prosateur par excellence</I>,
Tocqueville felt no need to forge a new style in order to render new
things. If he followed his older relative into the American
wilderness, it was not to register the palpitations of his soul
before the grandeur and immensity of the new world, even if he does,
in the odd passage, take on an almost Chateaubriandesque tone of
lugubrious delectation:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">As
in forests under man&rsquo;s dominion, death here worked its
ceaseless ravages, but no one took it upon himself to remove the
debris it left behind. Dead wood therefore piled up faster than it
could decay to make way for new growth. Yet even in the midst of all
this debris, the work of reproduction continued without letup.
Climbing vines and other plants crept among fallen trees and worked
their way into decaying remains; they lifted and broke the shriveled
bark that still clung to the dead wood, thereby clearing the way for
young shoots. Thus death in a way served life. Each looked the other
in the face, seemingly keen to mingle and confound their works.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">But Tocqueville was far
too conscious of Pascal&rsquo;s strictures against what a recent
editor has dubbed &ldquo;ego-history&rdquo; to have followed his
cousin down the road to Romanticism. While he admired Montaigne, whom
he quotes once in <I>Democracy in America</I>, he of course knew what
Pascal thought of the Bordeaux magistrate&rsquo;s &ldquo;<I>sot
projet &hellip; de se peindre</I>.&rdquo; Even in this brief
Romanticizing prose poem, we feel the continued presence of the
classical armature. Note the balance and equipoise of the periods.
One doesn&rsquo;t have to count syllables to sense how the sentence
that begins with &ldquo;Climbing vines&rdquo; rises to its pinnacle
in &ldquo;decaying remains&rdquo; only to race down the back slope
where &ldquo;young shoots&rdquo; are poking up through the soil. A
quick seven-word haymaker follows hard upon this undulating and
almost Proustian left hook, a short, sharp sentence built around the
antithesis between death and life, which stuns you with the
observation that death serves rather than curtails its double. (In
French there are twelve words; I flatter myself that the greater
concision of the English would have pleased Tocqueville and made up
for the slight slippage from <I>aider</I> to <I>serve</I>.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote4anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote4sym"><SUP>4</SUP></A></SUP>)
Thus even this Romantic thrust is mere drapery over the firmly
planted pillars of the classical temple that Tocqueville is
constructing sentence by sentence.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Translating the Classic</H3>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">With respect to stature,
substance, and style, Tocqueville&rsquo;s work can thus fairly be
called a classic. How does this special status affect the
translator&rsquo;s handling of the text? A classic bears a special
relation to other texts as well as a special relation to the language
in which it is written. There is a passage in which Tocqueville
speaks of the ease with which the leading men in aristocratic
societies can recognize one another. They stand above the rest, he
says, and easily spot each other from one hilltop fortress to the
next, as it were. Classics, too, are like this, and Tocqueville
clearly recognized certain prominent predecessors as peers with whom
he wished to enter into conversation. His is not the way of the
modern scholar, however. He does not adorn his text with frequent
footnotes to indicate where he has borrowed or with whom he agrees or
disagrees. He does not dissect the arguments of others in detail as
proof that he has understood and weighed them, not merely dismissed
them blindly or out of hand. He wants to influence his
contemporaries, and, knowing that many of them will be impatient of
any hint of pedantry, he does not wish to burden his prose with
exegesis. Often he merely alludes. To the wise a word is enough to
indicate what he is up to, an ironic reference sufficient to indicate
what he thinks. He will speak, for instance, of &ldquo;philosophers
and historians&rdquo; who assert that distance from the equator
determines the mores of women, and one knows that behind the
&ldquo;materialist doctrines&rdquo; he thus stigmatizes in passing,
he is indicating his distaste for Helv&eacute;tius, d&rsquo;Holbach,
and Diderot and his disagreement with a tendency in the thinking of
Montesquieu, for whom he elsewhere professes respect (II.3.11). A
certain delicacy is required in dealing with such a text lest subtle
references&mdash;hints contained in a lexical wisp or syntactic
murmur&mdash;be obscured.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">There is a contemporary
school of textual interpretation which takes this intertextual
subtlety a good deal further. Leo Strauss was its founder. Strauss
believed that the classics pose a special kind of interpretive
problem. The very fact that they are so widely studied can obscure or
falsify their deliberately cryptic messages. Incessant commentary
softens or edulcorates the most shocking insights of fundamental
works. The temptation to make classic texts &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; to
contemporary problems dilutes the vigor of their original language
and buries their hidden secrets even deeper. For Strauss, lulling
commentary on the great works diverts attention from what he calls
permanent problems: &ldquo;Many of our contemporaries are of the
opinion that there are no permanent problems and hence no permanent
alternatives.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote5anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote5sym"><SUP>5</SUP></A></SUP>
The proper way to read the classics, he suggests, is in relation to
one another, for at bottom they are engaged in a durable contest, a
fundamentally agonistic confrontation between alternative values.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Since these fundamental
texts are written in different languages, translation poses a special
problem for exponents of Straussian interpretation. The permanent
problems were first posed in Greek and Latin, then translated into
modern tongues. One thus gains insight into the clash of agonistic
values by paying close attention to the way in which modern
antagonists inflect certain terms of classical discourse. Reading
Machiavelli against Aristotle teaches us more about our own
modernity, say Straussians, than contemplating, as Tocqueville does
in one of his rare dilations upon a topical theme of actual American
politics, Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s opposition to the creation of a
national bank. And to be sure, Tocqueville is not so much diverted by
the circumstantial detail such an event provides as he is grateful
for the opportunity to expound classical <I>topoi</I> such as the
susceptibility of democracy to demagogy and the conversion of
military prowess into popular appeal. Since what the great
philosophers say is often veiled, Straussians contend, because it is
dangerous or offensive to established ways of thinking, it is
important that the translator refrain from disturbing signs that may
be the keys to recovering these encrypted meanings. Similarly,
contradictions must not be glossed over, nor should inconsistencies
be &ldquo;harmonized,&rdquo; lest clues to what was unassimilable or
contested or overlooked in the appropriation of ancient texts be
brushed aside.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote6anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote6sym"><SUP>6</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">If I devote attention to
these Straussian dogmas, to which I do not subscribe, it is in part
because Straussian scholars have done important work on Tocqueville.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote7anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote7sym"><SUP>7</SUP></A></SUP>
It is also because the most recent translation of <I>Democracy in
America</I>, by Professors Harvey Mansfield and Delba Winthrop,
explicitly places itself in the Straussian tradition. Before
Mansfield and Winthrop, however, other translators had labored to
make the text a classic in the United States even as it lapsed in
France from popularity into neglect.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote8anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote8sym"><SUP>8</SUP></A></SUP>
Tocqueville himself read and commented on the first translation of
his work, by Henry Reeve. He had this to say: &ldquo;Without wishing
to do so and by following the instinct of your opinions, you have
quite vividly colored what was contrary to Democracy and almost
erased what could do harm to Aristocracy.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote9anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote9sym"><SUP>9</SUP></A></SUP>
Note well Tocqueville&rsquo;s use of the word <I>instinct</I>. We&rsquo;ll
encounter it again. In any case, defective or not, Reeve&rsquo;s
translation, revised first by Francis Bowen and again by Phillips
Bradley, has remained in print. I have not studied the original
version to see if it merited Tocqueville&rsquo;s disapproval, which
seems to credit translation with more damage than it can do if it is
at all faithful. Perhaps Tocqueville was merely startled by a
reasonably accurate transcription of his own voice, as we often are
when we listen to a recording. In any case, we know that
Tocqueville&rsquo;s work has become a classic of the English
language, and surely it owes that status in part to the quality of
the joint effort of Reeve, Bowen, and Bradley, whose inexpensive
Modern Library edition, which I have studied, filled the need for a
text that made a case for democracy in America in the early years of
the Cold War, when Tocqueville&rsquo;s all too famous prediction that
the world would one day be divided between America and Russia seemed
to be coming true. Then, in the 1960s, George Lawrence published a
new translation, which, though it owed a great deal to its
predecessor, nevertheless spoke with a distinctly more contemporary
voice. Perhaps it was the clarity of that voice, or perhaps it was
the changed climate of the Sixties, but commentators seemed to become
more aware of certain of Tocqueville&rsquo;s doubts about the
democracy to which he had attempted to reconcile himself and his
fellow Frenchmen: his concern with corrosive individualism, mediocre
conformity, the tyranny of the majority, and similar themes now
commanded attention.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm"> In any case, the
Mansfield-Winthrop translation appeared shortly after I began work on
my own version of the text, taking its place after the
well-established Reeve-Bowen-Bradley and Lawrence versions. If
Tocqueville&rsquo;s book was widely studied and admired in American
schools, and therefore a classic in Littr&eacute;&rsquo;s primary
sense, the credit was due largely to Reeve, Bradley, Bowen, and
Lawrence. Whatever deficiencies their translations possessed, they
were not so debilitating as to rob the text of its claim to be a work
&ldquo;of the highest rank or importance, approved as a model&rdquo;&mdash;a
classic, in short. Whatever precedents my predecessors had
established therefore had to be weighed carefully&mdash;not
necessarily accepted merely because they were established but not
necessarily rejected solely for the sake of difference or novelty
either. In addition, I was now reminded by Mansfield and Winthrop of
the possibility that the text might be read in ways that made special
demands on the translator, whom they admonished to show &ldquo;reverence.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote10anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote10sym"><SUP>10</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">L&rsquo;Int&eacute;r&ecirc;t bien entendu</H3>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm"> Genuflection is one
thing, however; translation is another. Take a case in point: one
finds in Tocqueville the important concept of &ldquo;<I>l&rsquo;int&eacute;r&ecirc;t
bien entendu</I>.&rdquo; Reeve translated this phrase as
&ldquo;self-interest rightly understood,&rdquo; while Lawrence
preferred &ldquo;properly understood.&rdquo; I myself, in
translating, some years ago, <I>Tocqueville&rsquo;s Two Democracies</I>
by the late Jean-Claude Lamberti, adopted Lawrence&rsquo;s usage.
Schleifer glosses the phrase as &ldquo;enlightened self-interest.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote11anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote11sym"><SUP>11</SUP></A></SUP>
But Mansfield and Winthrop, professing a general preference for
literalism, for &ldquo;staying as close as possible to the original,&rdquo;
prefer &ldquo;self-interest well understood.&rdquo;</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Now, much discussion of
translation revolves around quibbles of this sort, which can be
tedious and unilluminating. How, precisely, is one to adjudicate
between &ldquo;interest well understood&rdquo; or &ldquo;properly
understood&rdquo; or &ldquo;rightly understood&rdquo; or
&ldquo;enlightened&rdquo;? It&rsquo;s a question of &ldquo;ear,&rdquo;
some will say, but of course the argument is perfectly circular: if
&ldquo;self-interest properly understood&rdquo; sounds right to you,
it may be that your ear, like mine, has already been shaped by prior
experience. Or maybe my ear is just off. There are scholars who say
that el Greco painted the human figure as he did because he suffered
from severe astigmatism; perhaps it is possible to suffer from an
astigmatism of the ear and consequently to prefer the misshapen to
the well-formed. Yet sharing el Greco&rsquo;s affliction is no
guarantee of sharing his genius.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">On the other hand, <I>not</I>
sharing el Greco&rsquo;s affliction is no guarantee of sharing his
genius either. The argument from literalism seems to me no more
persuasive than the argument from instinct. Must &ldquo;<I>bien</I>&rdquo;
be translated as &ldquo;well&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;properly&rdquo;
simply because it may be translated that way in some contexts? Can
one really say that &ldquo;well understood&rdquo; is &ldquo;closer to
the original&rdquo; than &ldquo;properly understood?&rdquo; After
all, there are many contexts in which it would not be at all natural
to translate <I>bien</I> as <I>well</I>. What about <I>c&rsquo;est
bien bon</I>, <I>c&rsquo;est bien simple</I>, or <I>c&rsquo;est bien
bizarre</I>? What about the formulaic <I>bien entendu</I>, which of
course means &ldquo;of course&rdquo;? Or the closing of a letter,
<I>bien &agrave; vous</I>. Or, to confine attention to <I>bien </I>as
adverbial modifier of a past participle, <I>il est bien venu que &hellip;</I>,
<I>il est bien entendu que &hellip;</I>? Or the formula <I>c&rsquo;est
bien trouv&eacute;</I>? The semantic range of the French morpheme
<I>bien</I> only partially overlaps the semantic range of the English
morpheme <I>well</I>: consider <I>le bien et le mal</I>, <I>le bien
national</I>, or <I>est-ce bien le train pour Paris</I>? The student
who receives <I>une mention bien</I> may regret that she didn&rsquo;t
receive a <I>tr&egrave;s bien, mais quand bien m&ecirc;me elle s&rsquo;est
acquitt&eacute;e tant bien que mal</I>, <I>et bien qu&rsquo;elle ne
soit pas trop brillante</I>. Consider, too, the difference between <I>je
veux</I> and <I>je veux bien</I>, <I>je t&rsquo;aime </I>and <I>je
t&rsquo;aime bien</I>. In none of the foregoing instances can <I>bien
</I>be translated as <I>well</I>, hence the defense of such a
translation as &ldquo;literal&rdquo; seems more a premise than a
proof. To complete the proof, one would presumably have to say why
<I>l&rsquo;int&eacute;r&ecirc;t bien entendu</I> has more in common
with <I>bien fait</I> or <I>bien jou&eacute; </I>than with <I>bien
venu </I>or <I>bien trouv&eacute;</I>.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">And that is not all: I
haven&rsquo;t yet touched on all that is left out (or smuggled in)
when we translate <I>int&eacute;r&ecirc;t</I> by its simple English
cognate <I>interest</I>, for in French one says <I>il y a int&eacute;r&ecirc;t
&agrave; faire quelque chose</I> without hinting at a utilitarian
doctrine of motivation. As Jon Elster pertinently remarks, La
Rochefoucauld denies that the word <I>int&eacute;r&ecirc;t</I> always
refers to &ldquo;a material interest&rdquo; (<I>un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t
de bien</I>); more often&mdash;in <I>l&rsquo;&acirc;ge classique</I>,
at any rate&mdash;it refers to &ldquo;an interest of honor or of
glory.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote12anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote12sym"><SUP>12</SUP></A></SUP>
In any event, the footsteps of Adam Smith and Jeremy Bentham dog the
Anglo-Saxon writer on political theory far more than they do the
French writer, who is likely to think of Helv&eacute;tius and the
rather different philosophical tradition conjured up by his name. For
if Helv&eacute;tius and not Bentham was, as Isaiah Berlin
persuasively argues, the true father of utilitarianism, he was also
the true heir of materialist mechanism, and it was as such that
Tocqueville combated his legacy even as he reached a compact of
understanding with Bentham&rsquo;s heir John Stuart Mill.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote13anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote13sym"><SUP>13</SUP></A></SUP>
What Tocqueville meant by <I>l&rsquo;int&eacute;r&ecirc;t bien
entendu</I> is therefore something that must emerge from his text as
a whole, and this fact tends to diminish the importance of the merely
local choices that one makes in translating this or that word.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">So where does this rapid
survey leave us? Is there simply no rational basis for choosing? Here
is a modest proposal. Let us toy with the hypothesis that &ldquo;properly
understood&rdquo; is preferable to &ldquo;well understood&rdquo;
because the latter formulation suggests that there is an unambiguous
notion of interest which the actor is well advised to grasp <I>well</I>,
or thoroughly, whereas the former suggests that interest is really a
rather slippery concept, that what we take to be in our interest
depends crucially on how we view the world and in particular on where
we take time&rsquo;s horizon to be situated, and therefore it
behooves us to understand our interest not merely well but <I>properly</I>,
that is, to choose among the many possible definitions of interest
the one that is truly the self&rsquo;s, or that is the true self&rsquo;s.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote14anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote14sym"><SUP>14</SUP></A></SUP>
As for &ldquo;rightly,&rdquo; one might see this as a compromise
solution, more ambiguous as to the nature of interest. Is &ldquo;properly&rdquo;
then a legitimate translation or an illegitimate substitution of the
translator&rsquo;s understanding or unconscious preference or opinion
for the author&rsquo;s? Does yet another option suggest itself? Or is
there perhaps no significant difference at all among the
alternatives? Am I imagining the nuance?</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">To pursue this point a
little farther, let me make a Straussian move to clarify the grounds
for my objection to the Straussian contention that, in the absence of
complete knowledge of a text, it is better to translate as literally
as possible&mdash;whatever &ldquo;literally&rdquo; might mean, and I
think I have shown already that there is a certain incoherence to the
notion. My Straussian move is to cite a writer whom Tocqueville never
mentions in <I>Democracy in America</I> but is known to have studied
closely, namely, Edmund Burke, and to strengthen my belief that I am
correctly reading what he does say by contrasting it with what he
doesn&rsquo;t say, but Burke does. Let me mention first that
Mansfield and Winthrop state in a footnote that the &ldquo;the actual
phrase &lsquo;self-interest well understood&rsquo; was apparently
first used by Etienne de Condillac in 1798.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote15anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote15sym"><SUP>15</SUP></A></SUP>
Of course what they mean to say is, &ldquo;the actual phrase &lsquo;<I>int&eacute;r&ecirc;t
bien entendu</I>.&rsquo;&rdquo; Attributing responsibility for their
translation to a French author is a slip, as is the date 1798, since
the <I>Trait&eacute; des animaux</I>, which they cite as the source,
was actually published in 1755 (Condillac died in 1780). In any case,
we find the following passage in Burke&rsquo;s <I>Reflections on the
Revolution in France</I>, published in 1799: 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">These
enthusiasts do not scruple to avow their opinion, that a state can
subsist without any religion better than with one and that they are
able to supply the place of any good which may be in it, by a project
of their own&mdash;namely, by a sort of education they have imagined,
founded in a knowledge of the physical wants of men; progressively
carried to an enlightened self-interest, which, when well understood,
they tell us, will identify with an interest more enlarged and
public.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote16anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote16sym"><SUP>16</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">It is striking to find
in Burke the phrase &ldquo;enlightened self-interest&rdquo; coupled
with the phrase &ldquo;well understood.&rdquo; Does this rule out
&ldquo;properly understood?&rdquo; On the contrary, I believe it
makes my case. To be sure, Burke&rsquo;s expression here is not
sparklingly pellucid. It is not altogether clear who is meant to
understand self-interest well, the enthusiastic educators or the men
they educate. Is the argument of the &ldquo;invisible hand&rdquo;
sort&mdash;that men so educated work blindly to satisfy themselves
but can nevertheless be seen, by those who understand well, to
contribute to the &ldquo;enlarged and public&rdquo; interest? Or is
it that men can be educated to understand that certain kinds of
apparent self-sacrifice in fact redound to one&rsquo;s own benefit,
hence that it makes sense for self-interested reasons to consider,
or, more cynically, to calculate, how one might &ldquo;do well by
doing good?&rdquo; It is not clear, either, whether Burke&rsquo;s
phrase &ldquo;progressively carried&rdquo; means that the doctrine of
interest is enlarged beyond &ldquo;physical wants&rdquo; or confined
within the sphere of the material.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm"> Tocqueville in any case
appears to share the concern that motivates the reformers whom Burke
disparages, for he says that in revolutionary times it is essential
&ldquo;to make the case that the interests of individuals and of the
nation are inextricably intertwined, because disinterested love of
country has vanished forever&rdquo; (I.2.6). But he also says that
while &ldquo;it is to be expected &hellip; that individual interest
will become more than ever the principal if not the sole motive of
human action, &hellip; it remains to be seen how each person will
interpret his individual interest&rdquo; (II.2.8), leaving to the
individual a freedom to interpret the lessons he is taught that Burke
seems to deny to the manipulated pupils of his cunningly coercive
educators. And far from seeing self-interest as merely an enlargement
of the sphere of physical wants and a substitute for religion,
Tocqueville believes that in America it has become an essential prop
of religion: &ldquo;Hence I see no clear reason why the doctrine of
self-interest properly understood should turn men away from religious
beliefs. On the contrary, I can make out ways in which it might draw
them toward religion.&rdquo;</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">That Tocqueville is
perfectly conversant with Burke&rsquo;s &ldquo;enthusiasts&rdquo; is
clear from the following passage, in which he calls them,
collectively, &ldquo;moralists&rdquo;:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">But
as &hellip; people began to concentrate on themselves, moralists
became alarmed by the idea of sacrifice and no longer dared hold it
up for the human mind to contemplate. They were accordingly reduced
to asking whether citizens might not find it to their individual
advantage to work for the good of all, and whenever they happened
upon one of the points where the particular interest intersects and
converges with the general interest, they were quick to call
attention to it. Little by little, such observations proliferated.
What was once just an isolated remark became a general doctrine, and
ultimately it came to seem as if man, in serving his fellow man,
served himself. (II.2.8)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">But Tocqueville, as I
shall show in a moment when I turn to a discussion of the word
<I>instinct</I>, sees this development in a more generous spirit than
Burke. He emphasizes the variety of ways in which interest can be not
only understood but acquired. For him, self-interest is not always
material and is not determined in advance by man&rsquo;s biological
nature. Nor is it a direct consequence of his position in society: it
is not true that the rich or the poor or the few or the many have
certain unalterably opposed interests simply because they are rich or
poor or more or less numerous. Their interests can be &ldquo;enlarged&rdquo;
and made more &ldquo;public&rdquo; by granting them rights, by
involving them in politics:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">It
is not within the power of the law to revive dying beliefs, but it is
within the power of the law to instill in people an interest in the
fate of their country. It is within the power of the law to awaken
and guide the vague patriotic instinct that dwells permanently in the
heart of man and, by linking that instinct to everyday thoughts,
passions, and habits, to turn it into a conscious and durable
emotion. Let it not be said that it is too late to try: nations do
not grow old in the same way as men. Each new generation born among
them is fresh material for the lawmaker to mold. (I.1.5)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Tocqueville, in other
words, sees interests as plastic and their shaping as an art, indeed,
the political art par excellence: the &ldquo;new political art,&rdquo;
if you will, which must be conjoined to his &ldquo;new political
science&rdquo; if the latter is to have any useful effect. And
Tocqueville wanted more than anything to have useful effect; his
theory was intended to be a tool, for as he put it in his
introduction, &ldquo;science [is] a means of government and
intelligence a social force.&rdquo; Clearly he had made his own what
Stephen Holmes calls a &ldquo;pivotal, but largely negelected,
liberal idea&rdquo; first formulated by Locke: &ldquo;Law, in its
true Notion, is not so much the Limitation as the direction of a free
and intelligent agent to his <I>proper Interest</I>, and prescribes
no further than is for the general Good of those under the Law.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote17anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote17sym"><SUP>17</SUP></A></SUP>
And here, <I>mirabile dictu</I>, we have an English-language
precedent for coupling the adjective &ldquo;proper&rdquo; to the idea
of &ldquo;interest&rdquo; in a thoroughly enlarged and
anti-materialist, hence plausibly Tocquevillean, sense.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">So that is my case for
believing that &ldquo;self-interest properly understood&rdquo; is a
better translation than &ldquo;self-interest well understood.&rdquo;
Does my argument carry absolute conviction? Surely not. Call it a
hunch. Or, to use a Tocquevillean word, an instinct. But an instinct
based on a long experience of turning French into English. Not that
this argument, trumped up after the fact, reflects the actual thought
process of the translator at work. I&rsquo;m afraid that he often is
swayed by the instincts not of his &ldquo;opinions,&rdquo; for which
Tocqueville reproached Reeve, but of his intellect and aesthetic,
that is, by the promptings not of his nature but of his second
nature, as Pascal styled culture. I had read Holmes&rsquo; book after
translating Lamberti and before undertaking <I>Democracy in America
</I>but did not in fact remember Locke&rsquo;s use of the phrase
&ldquo;proper interest&rdquo; until I refreshed my memory in writing
this paper. My argument, such as it is, is not a proper argument so
much as a description of the inner landscape that forms the
background to the translator&rsquo;s judgment. Why, at this or that
juncture, one prompting of his nature should outweigh another is a
bit of a mystery, but surely no less mysterious than the defense of
one possible translation on the grounds that it is &ldquo;closer&rdquo;
than some other to the original. Closer by what measure? The belief
that literal translation can get us closer to the text than an
honest, if inevitably partial, effort to grapple with its meaning
strikes me as a kind of scientistic fallacy, in that it seeks to
atomize the complexity of language the better to dominate it. It is
odd to find such a view of language associated with the name of
Strauss, who denounced what he called &ldquo;the &lsquo;scientific&rsquo;
approach to society&rdquo; as an &ldquo;abstraction from the moral
distinctions by which we take our bearings as citizens and as men.
The indispensable condition of &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; analysis is
then moral obtuseness.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote18anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote18sym"><SUP>18</SUP></A></SUP>
Literal translation, when it defies the instincts of the translator&rsquo;s
ear for his own as well as the foreign tongue, seems to me to suffer
from a comparable aural obtuseness. But perhaps I have said enough on
this point and should leave it at that.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Does it matter if I&rsquo;m
wrong in this choice? Probably not much, or at least I hope not.
Unless one happens to be a scholar for whom some argument hinges
crucially on this or that word choice, it&rsquo;s usually a mistake
to fetishize the lexical dimension of a text. Translation, though
practiced as an art of small choices, of relatively delicate, almost
imperceptible individual touches and brush strokes, is also, like any
art, subordinate to a larger order, to a principle of the whole. In
order to achieve that whole, the copyist must be allowed a certain
freedom to blend this detail with that. Slavish imitation, being
mechanical, saps the work&rsquo;s soul. A translation, like a
painting, must make an overall impression if the reader is to care
enough to follow its internal gradations and impastos, its subtle or
startling effects, its sfumati and pentimenti.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote19anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote19sym"><SUP>19</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Instinct</H3>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">So instinct is essential
in translation, but the instinct I&rsquo;ve been talking about is not
the brutish kind; it&rsquo;s a rather sophisticated sort of instinct,
a cultivated spontaneity. I&rsquo;ve tried, moreover, to contrast the
instinctive approach to translating to the overly rational one, which
would impose either a rule&mdash;translate <I>literally</I>&mdash;or
a method: translate as though your text were in conversation with the
classics and concerned ultimately if not exclusively with the
&ldquo;permanent problems.&rdquo; Now these are matters about which
Tocqueville had things to say. &ldquo;Instinct&rdquo; is a word that
occurs frequently in his work. The right relation of rationality to
instinct is a matter that concerns him deeply, as we shall see in a
moment. And he explicitly warns against believing that classical
thought is the best guide to the present: &ldquo;A world that is
totally new demands a new political science.&rdquo; 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">The old political
science that Tocqueville deemed no longer adequate was presumably
both the Enlightenment&rsquo;s and Aristotle&rsquo;s, more or less,
and Tocqueville certainly knew of Aristotle&rsquo;s dictum that there
is no science but of the general. If he aimed at science, he aimed at
the general, but generalities were also the occasion of his deepest
misgivings. In his very interesting chapter on language, he says:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">Generic
and abstract terms are the basis of all language. Hence I am not
claiming that such words are found only in democratic languages. All
I am saying is that men in ages of equality tend to increase the
number of words of this type in particular; they tend to take them
always in isolation, in their most abstract sense, and to use them
incessantly, even when the occasion does not require it. (II.1.16)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Thus the virtuous use of
language requires striking a just mean in the employment of general
terms, hence in the application of science. Tocqueville&rsquo;s
wariness of the theoretical and preference for the practical are well
known. Pragmatism is one quality for which he praises Americans, the
lack of it one vice for which he chastises revolutionaries in France.
In aristocratic societies language can be more concrete than abstract
or theoretical, moreover, because it &ldquo;inevitably partakes of
the general ambience of repose. Few new words are created, because
few new things come to pass. If anyone did anything new, moreover, he
would try to describe it using familiar words whose meaning had been
fixed by tradition.&rdquo; By contrast, &ldquo;the perpetual fluidity
that is so prominent a feature of democracy is forever reshaping the
face of language as well as of business.&rdquo;</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">If the real is so fluid
that language cannot fix it in words, cannot <I>literally</I>
transcribe things as they are, then science must be supplemented by
art. This was of course true for the old Aristotelian political
science as well, but Tocqueville&rsquo;s doubts about the guidance
that reason can offer man were unknown to Aristotle. They are
informed by a Pascalian pessimism as to man&rsquo;s nature. &ldquo;<I>Le
coeur a ses raisons, que la raison ne conna&icirc;t pas</I>,&rdquo;
Pascal wrote; the heart has its reasons, which reason knows not. For
Pascal, who believed that the divide between head and heart was an
abyss, the asceticism of Port Royal was the only possible life. But
Tocqueville chose an active life in politics. Clearly he held out
hope&mdash;did he take it from Rousseau?&mdash;that the head might
yet heed the heart and the heart be instructed by the head.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">For Tocqueville as for
Pascal, excessive faith in reason was associated with a name:
Descartes. &ldquo;Cartesianism,&rdquo; Tocqueville tells us, is the
&ldquo;common philosophical method&rdquo; of the Americans, even
though they &ldquo;do not read Descartes, because their social state
discourages speculative studies&rdquo; (II.1.1). He gives several
reasons why this should come as no surprise. Equality of conditions
is corrosive of authority:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">As
for the possibility of one intelligence influencing another, it is
necessarily quite limited in a country whose citizens, having become
more or less identical, can observe each other at close range. Seeing
that no one possesses any incontestable mark of greatness or
superiority, each person is forced back on the most obvious and
accessible source of truth, his own reason. What is destroyed as a
result is not only confidence in any particular individual but also
the readiness to believe anyone solely on the basis of his word. Each
person therefore retreats within the limits of the self and from that
vantage ventures to judge the world.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Not only is intellectual
authority thus destroyed; so, too, is the authority of classes, of a
seemingly natural and settled order of things.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote20anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote20sym"><SUP>20</SUP></A></SUP>
Intergenerational authority is also undermined, for &ldquo;in the
constant state of flux that prevails in a democratic society, the
bond that ties generation to generation is loosened or broken. People
easily lose track of the ideas of their ancestors or cease to care
about them.&rdquo;</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">The upshot of these
several blows to authority is that &ldquo;in most activities of the
mind the American relies solely on the unaided effort of his own
individual reason.&rdquo; Democratic societies are thus led naturally
to adopt a philosophy that Descartes derived from inspection of his
own <I>cogito</I>. The consequence of this, for Tocqueville, is an
ominous democratic hubris: &ldquo;Equality of conditions fosters a &hellip;
very high and often quite exaggerated idea of human reason.&rdquo;
(II.1.2)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">This is a perfectly
Pascalian thought. It owes nothing to skepticism. The skeptic doubts
the power of reason to know anything. Tocqueville, like Pascal, had
nothing but the highest respect for reason; witness his frequent
remarks on the indispensability of <I>les lumi&egrave;res</I>, of
enlightenment, as a <I>sine qua non</I> of democracy. &ldquo;All our
dignity consists in thought,&rdquo; he could have said with the
Jansenist philosopher (P348). Yet if thought constitutes man&rsquo;s
nobility, man is still as nothing before the unfathomable depths of
the universe: &ldquo;A vapor, a drop of water, is enough to kill
him,&rdquo; said Pascal. &ldquo;Man is but a reed, the weakest in
nature. But he is a thinking reed.&rdquo;</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">For Pascal, it was the
immensity and variability of the universe and of the individual soul
that inspired humility and warned against undue confidence in the
powers of reason.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">I
spent much of my life believing that some kind of justice existed,
and in that I was not mistaken, for justice does exist, insofar as
God has willed that it be revealed to us. But I did not take it that
way, and there I was mistaken, for I believed that our justice was
essentially just and that I possessed the means to know and to judge
it. Yet I found myself so often wanting right judgment that in the
end I became wary of myself and then of others. I have seen changes
in all countries and all men, and I understood that our nature was
one of constant change. (P378)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">For Tocqueville, the
providential increase in the equality of conditions signaled the kind
of justice that God intended but did nothing to bolster man&rsquo;s
feeble reason in the face of the immensity of the unknowable,
including what was unknowable or at the very least unavowable within
himself. Indeed, the passage to a democratic social state entailed
debilities in the faculties of reason not contemplated by Pascal. Man
now found himself alone, isolated, helpless, and weak vis-&agrave;-vis
not just the multitudinous universe but also the multitudes of his
fellow men. With the transfer of intellectual authority to the mass,
opinion gains a power it had not previously possessed (II.1.2). The
end of studious idleness owing to the universal injunction to work
means that the few who have a taste for higher studies may lack the
opportunity for it, while those who acquire the opportunity may have
lost the taste. The restless mobility of the democratic social state
forsakes fixed ideas for the bewildering swirl of amorphous opinion,
which Tocqueville compares in a fine metaphor to &ldquo;intellectual
dust, blown about by every wind and unable to coalesce into any fixed
shape.&rdquo; (II.1.1)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">What, then, was the
point of a new political science, if ideas commanded so little
authority, if their imprecision led to error rather than insight, and
if reason in the best of cases was dwarfed by immense and dimly
understood forces and combated within the bosom of man himself by the
power of the passions? Let me say in advance where I am headed: the
new political science, I believe, was intended to direct the new
political art, whose purpose was to shape man&rsquo;s instincts, for
when the light of reason fails and circumstances are unprecedented,
instinct is all that man possesses to set himself on the right
course.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Several passages from
Pascal bear on this point. Let me enumerate them first, then gloss
them in an effort to suggest how Tocqueville transformed Pascal&rsquo;s
thoughts. Pascal tells us that &ldquo;two things instruct man by way
of his entire nature: instinct and experience. Instinct seems to be
aspiration to the good, memory of our primitive perfection;
experience is knowledge of our misery and our fall&rdquo; (P404).
There is, Pascal says, &ldquo;intestine warfare in man between reason
and the passions;&rdquo; as a result of this war, those &ldquo;who
wanted peace divided into two sects. Some sought to renounce the
passions and become gods; others sought to renounce reason and become
brute beasts.&rdquo; &ldquo;But they were unable to do so. Reason
persists always, accusing the baseness and injustice of the passions
and disturbing the repose of those who yield to them; and the
passions live on in those who would renounce them.&rdquo;</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Now, how did Tocqueville
read this account of a tragic and inexpugnable doubleness in the soul
of man? First, he did not believe that men could purge themselves of
their passions and become gods. His contemporary Hegel held that
history had carried out such a purification by setting man&rsquo;s
reason over against man himself in the form of the bureaucratic
state, a human construct that nevertheless presented itself as the
embodiment of suprahuman rationality. Marx assigned a similar role to
a different actor, the working class, whose interests he assumed to
be identical with the interests of man as species. Tocqueville&rsquo;s
realism on this point set his thinking on a radically different
course that established him for posterity as the principal
theoretical adversary of the Hegelian-Marxist understanding, a
circumstance that undoubtedly played a part in securing his present
classic status.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Second, Tocqueville
agreed with Pascal about the instructive value of instinct and
experience. Pay particular attention to the former word, <I>instinct</I>.
It occurs in no fewer than 49 of the 83 chapters of <I>Democracy in
America</I>. Tocqueville uses it in its etymological sense, meaning
&ldquo;instigation, impulse, or prompting.&rdquo; There was
originally no connotation of innateness, and in fact Tocqueville
speaks in some places of instincts as things that can be acquired or
that depend on society for their nurturing, so clearly he does not
assume that instincts are inborn and immutable.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote21anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote21sym"><SUP>21</SUP></A></SUP>
This original meaning was still current in Tocqueville&rsquo;s
French. He shared it, in fact, with those &ldquo;materialist
philosophers&rdquo; whose hostility to religion made them his
enemies. Pierre Naville, a student of the writings of the baron
d&rsquo;Holbach,  remarks that &ldquo;d&rsquo;Holbach emphasizes
above all the <I>acquired</I> character of what is called instinct
(physical or moral).&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote22anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote22sym"><SUP>22</SUP></A></SUP>
Furthermore, he is keen to show that &ldquo;<I>moral instincts</I>&ndash;what
we would call penchants, dispositions, attitudes, behaviors&mdash;are
no more &lsquo;innate&rsquo; than physical instincts.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote23anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote23sym"><SUP>23</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Now, I&rsquo;ve compiled
a long list of passages in which Tocqueville uses the word <I>instinct.</I>
Time is too short to read them all. Instead I&rsquo;ll summarize the
varied and even contradictory ways in which Tocqueville uses the
word. Several themes stand out. They are not consistent with one
another, and in certain places Tocqueville will emphasize one
connotation of the term and suppress others.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">First, he sometimes sets
instinct in opposition to reason, just as Pascal does. Reason is
light; it sees. Instinct is blind. Reason reflects upon itself and is
cold or calculating, instinct warm and passionate and immediate. Thus
the purpose of <I>Democracy in America</I> is to &ldquo;substitute &hellip;
understanding of true interests for blind instinct&rdquo; (Intro.)
&ldquo;Egoism is born of blind instinct&rdquo; (II.2.2). Yet he can
also say that &ldquo;what was calculation becomes instinct&rdquo;
(II.2.4).<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote24anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote24sym"><SUP>24</SUP></A></SUP>
This last quote suggests a narrowing or bridging of the gap between
instinct and reason such as we find already in d&rsquo;Holbach, who
wrote that &ldquo;<I>to have instinct</I> (<I>avoir de l&rsquo;instinct</I>)
means simply to judge promptly and without need of lengthy
argument.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote25anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote25sym"><SUP>25</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Second, instinct, as for
the materialists, is associated with an array of other unreflective
motivations such as taste, thirst, passion, character, tendency,
predilection, proclivity. All are forms of what Aristotle would call
disposition, consequences of the way a thing is constituted, of the
nature or arrangement of its parts. &ldquo;The majority &hellip;
often has the tastes and instincts of a despot&rdquo; (I.2.8).
Students of the law acquire &ldquo;a taste for forms and a sort of
instinctive love of regular sequence in ideas&rdquo; (I.2.8). &ldquo;A
taste for the tangible and the real &hellip; as well as contempt for
traditions and forms&rdquo; are &ldquo;general instincts&rdquo; of
individuals living in conditions of equality (II.1.10).<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote26anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote26sym"><SUP>26</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Third, when it comes to
indicating the strength of instincts relative to other motives for
action such as reason, interest, or opinion, Tocqueville speaks in
two distinctly different registers. Sometimes an instinct is a weak
form of desire, an attenuated passion. These are the passages in
which he associates <I>instinct</I> with <I>taste</I> and its
cousins. At other times, however, instinct is an all but irresistible
force, a drive not unlike the drives or instincts in Freud or
concupiscence in Aristotle. Tocqueville doesn&rsquo;t speak of
subconscious drives but he does attach great importance to &ldquo;secret
instincts.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote27anc" HREF="classic.htm#sdendnote27sym"><SUP>27</SUP></A></SUP>
&ldquo;All bodies &hellip; harbor a secret instinct that impels them
toward independence&rdquo; (I.2.10). Nothing is &ldquo;more contrary
to nature and to the secret instincts of the human heart&rdquo; than
the subjection of a people to a noble caste (I.2.10).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Fourth, instinct is a
force that reason or spirit or cunning may choose either to resist or
to enlist. &ldquo;Religion, by respecting all democratic instincts
not hostile to it and by enlisting some of them in its own behalf,
successfully struggles against the spirit of individual independence,
which is for it the most dangerous&rdquo; (II.1.5). &ldquo;Suppose
that a man &hellip; resists instinct at every turn and coldly
calculates all the actions of his life&rdquo; (II.2.9). There can be
&ldquo;constant tension&rdquo; between &ldquo;the instincts to which
equality gives rise and the means it provides for their
satisfaction,&rdquo; and this tension &ldquo;torments and tires the
soul&rdquo; (II.2.13).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Fifth, man is part
brute, part angel, and in the contest between the two the instincts
are ambivalent: &ldquo;The instinct and taste of the human race
support this doctrine&rdquo; of spiritualism and &ldquo;often save it
from men themselves&rdquo; (II.2.15), yet men also &ldquo;lapse
easily into that state of complete and brutish indifference to the
future that is only too consistent with certain instincts of the
human species&rdquo; (II.2.17).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Finally, we must
consider the temporal nature of instincts. Are they durable
dispositions, properties of a thing&rsquo;s nature, intrinsic
qualities, as Tocqueville&rsquo;s language sometimes suggests? Or are
they, as he implies elsewhere, like certain passions: products of
circumstance, transitory, inconstant? &ldquo;Democratic instincts
were awakened&rdquo; (I.1.3). &ldquo;Parties are an evil inherent in
free governments, but their character and instincts are not always
the same&rdquo; (I.2.2). &ldquo;The periodical press seems to me to
have instincts and passions of its own, independent of the
circumstances in which it operates&rdquo; (I.2.3). &ldquo;When
opinions are in doubt, people end up relying on instinct and material
interest to guide them&rdquo; (I.2.3). But it is difficult to judge
the &ldquo;permanent instincts of democracy&rdquo; (I.2.5). As often
as not, instinct occupies a middle position: it is like love, at once
circumstantial and durable. Indeed, &ldquo;instinctive love&rdquo; of
one&rsquo;s country &ldquo;stems primarily from the immediate,
disinterested, indefinable sentiment that ties a man&rsquo;s heart to
the place where he was born.&rdquo; It is a &ldquo;habit&rdquo; and
&ldquo;attached to memories.&rdquo; As such it links up with another
key term in Tocqueville, <I>mores</I>, whose definition he says he
takes from the Ancients: &ldquo;I apply [the term] not only to mores
in the strict sense, what one might call habits of the heart, but
also to the various notions that men possess, to the diverse opinions
that are current among them, and to the whole range of ideas that
shape habits of the mind.&rdquo; Instincts, then, are in this guise
like mores in the strict sense, &ldquo;habits of the heart,&rdquo;
quasi-durable and unreflective dispositions to act in certain ways,
yet subject to modification by a range of notions, opinions, and
ideas, which together determine &ldquo;habits of the mind&rdquo;
(I.2.9).</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Instinct and Art</H3>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">So the new political
art, we might say, comes down to winning hearts and minds. How is
this to be done? Tocqueville&rsquo;s answers are characteristically
nuanced and frustratingly scattered throughout his text. He envisions
for society times of stability and times of instability. Instinct is
likely to be tenacious, opinions and ideas more volatile but by the
same token more supple and adaptable. Hence one might be well advised
to place confidence in instincts during times of stability and in
ideas in times of flux. But flux can be so rapid as to cloud the mind
and discourage the heart. In such dark times, neither instinct nor
reason can be counted on, but the legislator instructed in the new
political science may seek to order the parts of a polity in such a
way that its instincts in the face of unforeseen circumstance offer
it the best chance of survival. Here I must allow myself to quote
Tocqueville at greater length:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">In
the life of a nation &hellip; there may come a time when ancient
customs are transformed, mores decay, faiths are shaken, memories
lose their prestige, but enlightenment has yet to complete its work
and political rights remain insecure or limited. At such times the
only light in which men can see their country is a feeble and dubious
one. Patriotic feeling no longer attaches to the soil, which to the
people who live on it has become mere inanimate earth; or to
ancestral customs, which they have learned to see as confining; or to
religion, of which they are skeptical; or to the laws, which they do
not make; or to the lawmaker, whom they fear and despise. Hence they
cannot see their country anywhere, in either its proper guise or any
other, and they withdraw into narrow, unenlightened selfishness. They
have escaped prejudice but not yet embraced the empire of reason.
Lacking both the instinctive patriotism of monarchy and the
considered patriotism of a republic, they find themselves stuck
somewhere between the two, surrounded by confusion and misery.
(I.2.6)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Deprived of the guidance
of both instinct and enlightenment, man is rudderless. In such a
predicament, a conservative might be expected to appeal to
traditional values, to invoke the need for order, to rely on
prescriptive authority. Tocqueville&rsquo;s proposal may therefore
surprise those who think of him as a conservative:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">What
to do in such a situation? Retreat. But nations no more revert to the
sentiments of their youth than do men to the innocent desires of
childhood. Though they may long to feel such feelings again, nothing
can revive them. So there is no choice but to proceed forthrightly
and with all deliberate speed to make the case that the interests of
individuals and of the nation are inextricably intertwined, because
disinterested love of country has vanished forever.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">Far
be it from me to suggest that in order to achieve this end, full
political rights must immediately be granted to all men.
Nevertheless, the most powerful way of persuading men that they have
a stake in their country&rsquo;s fate, and perhaps the only way still
available to us, is to see to it that they participate in its
government. The civic spirit today seems to me intimately intertwined
with the exercise of political rights, and I think that from now on
the number of citizens in Europe will rise and fall in proportion to
the extension of such rights. (I.2.6)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">If instinct fails in a
crisis that unfolds more rapidly than reason can grasp it, disaster
follows. It is therefore prudent for political science to nurture
healthy instincts in the citizenry before crisis strikes. To
accomplish this, interest must be properly understood, by which I
mean, and I think Tocqueville meant, that the way in which interests
arise out of instincts, and hence the link between the core of the
self and its rational expressions, is central to the art of politics.
Tocqueville wants no part of Burke&rsquo;s contempt for reform, even
if he shares Burke&rsquo;s scorn for those reformers who think they
can lead the herd by feeding its appetites. He believes that men can
be educated not by a direct application of reason&mdash;not by
abstract argument or manipulative calculation&mdash;but by
participation in a polity contrived by reason to nurture true
instincts. Once confronted with the practical problems of government,
men will see, concretely, that &ldquo;they have a stake in their
country&rsquo;s fate.&rdquo; Their instincts will be modified
accordingly&mdash;instincts in the sense of tastes. In the language
of neoclassical economics&mdash;the intellectual heir of that
materialist utilitarianism which Tocqueville greeted initially not
with Burkean sarcasm but with the irony of the moralists of <I>l&rsquo;&acirc;ge
classique</I>&mdash;their schedule of preferences will change, and
hence their interests. So interest, an abstract word which in
Tocqueville&rsquo;s lexicon starts out on the side of calculation and
Cartesian reason, is drawn by the art of politics to the side of
virtue, to the idea of a conscious and deliberate fashioning of the
self. It is not simply that the sphere of private interest is
&ldquo;enlarged&rdquo; to encompass the public interest. At the same
time the public spirit is compressed and concentrated in the
individual mind. The soul of democratic man undergoes modification
through his participation in government. Just as, in the democratic
family, &ldquo;habit and need&rdquo; foster &ldquo;intimacy&rdquo;
between father and sons which &ldquo;makes the father&rsquo;s
authority less absolute&rdquo; (II.3.8) but develops a new and vital
family instinct unknown in aristocratic society, so, too, can the
legislator craft laws intended to develop new instincts in the
citizens of a democracy.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Let me return now to
translation. The transition may seem abrupt, but there is, I believe,
a connection between the art of politics and the art of translation.
Tocqueville wrote that &ldquo;the legislator is like a navigator on
the high seas. He can steer the vessel on which he sails, but he
cannot alter its construction, raise the wind, or stop the ocean from
swelling beneath his feet&rdquo; (I.1.8). The translator finds
himself in a similar predicament. Whatever his preparation for his
task may be, he cannot bring to the text precisely the same
presuppositions as the author. He cannot alter the construction of
the work, but he can study its most minute details. He can prepare
himself as well by exploring many other texts before facing the
challenge. In confronting a classic, he will also need to take
account of the winds of conflicting interpretation that blow from
every quarter of the compass. But in the moment, with the blank page
before him and all his prior reading and translating stretched out
behind him like a wake on the surface of the sea, and all the
swirling maelstrom of commentary set to one side, he has only his
instinct to rely on. He is, if I may presume to make a rather
grandiose comparison, like the statesman in a moment of crisis.
Argument, explication, criticism, comparison&mdash;the tools of
reason&mdash;all these are occupations for dry land. Instinct is not
much of a defense for his spur-of-the-moment decisions unless he
arrives safely in port. And that, ultimately, is not in his power to
decide, any more than it is in the power of the legislator to divine
what fate holds in store for the people whose instincts he has tried
to shape, to make ready for every contingency.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">So I have spoken for
nearly an hour only to tell you that in the end I translated one
phrase, &ldquo;self-interest properly understood,&rdquo; exactly as
one of my predecessors did, and that despite the complex web of
meanings and allusions that Tocqueville wove around the word
<I>instinct</I>, I felt I had no choice but to translate it by its
misleading English cognate. Here you see what is so humbling about
the work of the translator. He has to wear his learning so lightly
that he is likely to appear naked, and in the end he must rely on his
own instincts to do the right thing and on the instincts of his
readers to divine when he has done so. Translation is thus an act of
faith, or at any rate the simulation of faith. For unless one has
faith that in translating it is possible to do better than literal
transcription, one won&rsquo;t do better. Recall Tocqueville&rsquo;s
own words, which echo the wager of Pascal:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">What
I am about to say will do me no good in the eyes of politicians. I
believe that the only effective way for governments to honor the
dogma of the immortality of the soul is to act every day as though
they believed in it themselves. And I believe that it is only by
conforming scrupulously to religious morality in great affairs that
they can boast of teaching citizens to know it, love it, and respect
it in small ones. (II.2.15)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Similarly, what I am
about to say will do me no good in the eyes of my critics, but if the
translator truly wishes to honor the notion that the work before him
is a classic, that it has the power to instruct, to inspire, to
command respect, he must translate as though he believed it. He must
not, while professing humility, imperiously strip the work of the
mystique from which it derives its immortality. If, as Pascal says,
&ldquo;instinct seems to be aspiration to the good,&rdquo; the denial
of instinct is wrong, the insistence on method a trap, and the
repudiation of freedom a betrayal that would leave mastery
exclusively to the masters of a method sanctioned only by themselves.
Classicism properly understood isn&rsquo;t a constraint; it&rsquo;s a
liberation.</P>

	Of course we tend to talk about the lexical rather than other
	aspects of that overall impression precisely because we <I>can</I>
	talk about them: it&rsquo;s easy to point to a word and to a
	dictionary definition and say, <I>See</I>, <U>that</U>&rsquo;s what
	<U>it</U> means. In doing so we take toward prose an attitude rather
	like that which Dr. Johnson took toward matter when he kicked the
	rock and said, &ldquo;I refute Berkeley thus.&rdquo; But Johnson,
	though a lexicographer, was no literalist: he described his
	dictionary as &rdquo;the dreams of a poet doomed at last to wake a
	lexicographer&rdquo; and is remembered as much for his
	extracurricular and poetically licentious glosses on the meaning of
	words such as &ldquo;patriotism&rdquo; as for his efforts to
	regiment the unruliness of Shakespeare&rsquo;s tongue. Even formal
	prose is rather more ragtag than regimented. In translating the word
	<I>bien</I>, it&rsquo;s not as if the translator passes in review
	the whole army of possibilities that I evoked above. The point is
	precisely that one doesn&rsquo;t recite the rosary in this way. To
	one who knows the language, the potential alternative uses of <I>bien</I>
	and the conceivable implications of each permissible choice of a
	translation hover as silent as ghosts around the actual embodiment
	not only of the author&rsquo;s palpable intent but of possibilities
	latent in his language that deserve to be preserved for the reader
	without access to the original. These ghosts influence the
	translation, as do other unarticulated elements such as the rhythm
	of the text&rsquo;s sentences, the balance of its periods, the grace
	or gruffness of its tone, the hint that the author was smiling when
	he stabbed at his paper with particular vigor in bringing to a full
	stop a particularly well-turned phrase. In the translator&rsquo;s
	ear these mute voices run like a counterpoint to the text&rsquo;s
	main line, influencing his song even if he would be hard pressed to
	say precisely how. If he doesn&rsquo;t hear those voices, he isn&rsquo;t
	likely to achieve the proper overall effect.</P>

	The suggestion of innateness probably grew out of the use of the
	word as a verb. The OED, for example, cites this sentence from 1549:
	&ldquo;The good simple people of the olde golden worlde &hellip;
	lived onely as Nature taught and instincted them.&rdquo; Hence it
	was the idea that nature prompts people to act in certain ways that
	gave rise to the notion of instinct as an innate prompting, an
	instigation by nature. The original sense vanished from English some
	time after 1730, the date of the last example given in this sense by
	the OED.</P>
