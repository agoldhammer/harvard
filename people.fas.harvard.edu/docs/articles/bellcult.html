</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">David Bell has written a
remarkably lucid, deeply learned, and thoroughly stimulating book,
which brings a fresh and engaging point of view to a subject in need
of precisely that. I could easily spend my twenty minutes heaping
praise on the work and bestowing garlands on the author. Having come
to the work straight from Tocqueville&rsquo;s <I>Democracy in
America</I>, of which I&rsquo;ve just finished a new translation, I
was struck by echoes of some of Tocqueville&rsquo;s themes. This
started me on a series of reflections, which I will collect under
three heads: &ldquo;the cult of the nation,&rdquo; to borrow from
David&rsquo;s title; the so-called linguistic turn in historiography;
and the matter of chronology in intellectual and cultural history.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Let me begin, then, with
&ldquo;the cult of the nation in France.&rdquo; That the concept of
the nation carries a sacred charge is one of David&rsquo;s
fundamental themes. &ldquo;Historically,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;Western
nationalism, patriotism, and religion have twisted around each other
like sinuous vines.&rdquo; Hence he is surprised to discover &ldquo;that
few modern scholars have explored the connections [between the nation
and the sacred] in a satisfactory manner.&rdquo; [22] His chief
complaint is that &ldquo;religion most often serves these writers
principally as a convenient, uncomplicated symbol for something
else.&rdquo;[23]</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">In place of such
convenient but misleading simplicity David offers a more complex and
nuanced view of the advent of &ldquo;nation talk&rdquo; in France. He
envisions this process of historical change &ldquo;as having occurred
in two distinct, if connected realms &hellip; the realm of religious
thought and the realm of material organization.&rdquo; [27] Invoking
the work of Marcel Gauchet and Keith Baker, he makes two key points:
first, that &ldquo;the intellectual achievements of the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, by so clearly delineating
the terrestrial sphere, also demanded a new vocabulary to describe it
and to help human beings discern and maintain order and stability in
the face of the terrifying absence of God,&rdquo; [29] and second,
that changes in the material organization of society, and in
particular in the ways and scale of warfare, entailed &ldquo;a
striking shift in the way France&rsquo;s educated elites dealt with
and perceived themselves and their government.&rdquo; [35] Out of
this shift came &ldquo;new or newly redefined foundational concepts
of <I>soci&eacute;t&eacute;, civilisation, patrie, nation,</I> and
<I>public</I>. Each allowed [elites] to imagine an arena of
harmonious human coexistence whose principles did not ultimately
derive from the dictates of an (increasingly absent) God.&rdquo;
[35-36]</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">The Tocquevillean echoes
will be apparent. Their presence is not surprising, because Marcel
Gauchet, the political theorist on whom David draws so heavily, was
himself deeply influenced by Tocqueville. Of course Tocqueville
cannot see the phenomenon from beyond it, as it were, from a
postmodern perspective in which the cult of the nation has become, as
David himself once observed in a review of Pierre Nora&rsquo;s <I>magnum
opus</I>, a <I>lieu de m&eacute;moire</I>. Tocqueville was caught up
in it, at once an exemplar and epitome of the historical
transformation that David sets before us. We know from Tocqueville&rsquo;s
biographers that he suffered a religious crisis in his youth brought
on by &ldquo;the terrifying absence of God&rdquo; from the affairs of
the world. His religious upbringing was influenced by the
Augustinian-Jansenist strain in French Catholicism, in which the
theology of the <I>deus absconditus</I> or hidden God on which David
places so much emphasis was most prominent. We know that Tocqueville
viewed statecraft as a high calling, religious in the sense that it
lifted man&rsquo;s gaze from the gratification of worldly and selfish
tastes to the realm of the transcendent and eternal. We also know
that he saw the nation as the fitting and indeed &ldquo;natural&rdquo;
sphere of political action, the theater in which a providential
equalization of conditions was to be achieved. Now, this implication
of Tocqueville in the historical process of sacralization has its
costs: there are things he cannot see. But it also has its benefits.
As a participant he tends to view the process as one whose course is
not fixed and determined in advance. Indeed, his chief purpose is to
discover ways in which it can be inflected. Hence he writes, even at
his most philosophical, always with a political and even polemical
aim, whereas we are free to look back with the detachment,
skepticism, and at times cynicism of posterior wisdom, which can be a
delusory source of comfort. Nevertheless, I think we can still read
him with profit.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">For one thing, he views
the operation of a &ldquo;cult&rdquo; from an angle somewhat
different from David&rsquo;s and therefore notices different things.
I should perhaps point out that David&rsquo;s own point of view
shifts between chapters one and two. In chapter one he is concerned
with the emergence of the cult of the nation as a new unifying
principle. In chapter two he moves to a consideration of the
<I>political</I> contest that erupts over the <I>representation</I>
of the putatively unitary sentiments of the nation, with one faction
rallying around the word <I>patrie</I>, the other around the word
<I>nation</I>. [68ff] Here he sees the relation between religious
rhetoric and patriotic rhetoric as primarily instrumental: the
religious concept of the unity of all souls in the eye of God is
&ldquo;carried over,&rdquo; to use a Tocquevillean locution, to the
political realm and to polemical ends. There is a political urgency
to this task: &ldquo;The traditional rituals and rhetoric designed to
render the monarchy sacred were losing their effect.&rdquo; [67]
Legal discourse drawing on notions of the &ldquo;traditional
constitution&rdquo; no longer had the power to persuade, but, David
argues, a new discourse had arisen to take its place, a discourse
that drew upon theological rhetoric but applied it to terrestrial
objects.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Tocqueville tells a
similar story but with a somewhat different emphasis and a very
different vocabulary. He is struck by the lag in the application of
what he calls Cartesian reason to the realm of political philosophy,
as opposed to natural philosophy, where it had already swept the
field.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">Why
did Descartes, seeking to limit the employment of his method to
certain subjects even though he had developed it to apply to all,
state that only philosophical and not political questions should be
subject to individual scrutiny? How did it come about that in the
eighteenth century people suddenly derived from the same method
general applications that Descartes and his predecessors had either
not noticed or refused to see? &hellip; The philosophical method we
are discussing was born in the sixteenth century and developed and
generalized in the seventeenth. But it could not be widely adopted in
either. The political laws, the social state, the habits of mind that
derive from these primary causes worked against it. [DA, II.1.1,
515-6] 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Note Tocqueville&rsquo;s
emphasis on the importance of laws, the social state, and the habits
of mind that derive from them in determining when and where the
Cartesian method can be applied. The tendency toward greater equality
of condition that transforms both the social state and political laws
also affects habits of mind. This is Tocqueville&rsquo;s language for
describing what David understands in terms of an interplay between
the realm of material organization and the realm of thought. In
certain respects, to be sure, Tocqueville looked upon the democratic
mind as <I>un terrible simplificateur</I>. What he says about
pantheistic thinking in theology can be applied almost without change
to nationalist thought in political philosophy:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">As
conditions become more equal and each man in particular becomes more
similar to all others, weaker and smaller, one stops looking at
citizens and becomes accustomed to considering only the people; one
forgets individuals and thinks only of the species.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">In
such times, the human mind is keen to embrace a host of diverse
objects simultaneously. It invariably aspires to associate a
multitude of consequences with a single cause. (II.1.7)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">David is of course
concerned primarily with the verbal and iconic manifestations of the
new cult, the tokens of its existence. Signifiers such as these are
relatively weightless and change easily. The habits of the mind and
heart that ultimately preoccupy Tocqueville are more obdurate. They
require changes in practices as well as speech, in rituals and forms
as well as doctrine: &ldquo;I firmly believe in the necessity of
forms. I know that they enable the human mind to contemplate abstract
truths with a steady gaze and, by helping it grasp such truths
firmly, allow it to embrace them ardently. I do not imagine that
religion can be maintained without external practices.&rdquo;
(II.1.5) 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">The issue here is not
simply the ancient and irresolvable conflict between nominalism and
realism. Do words name things, or do linguistic structures shape our
perception of what there is in the world? That is a question for
philosophers, whereas Tocqueville was, at least part of the time, a
practical politician who believed that what people felt, more than
what they said, was the key to acting on them. He would have
subscribed to William Graham Sumner&rsquo;s dictum (quoted by David
Hackett Fischer in <I>Albion&rsquo;s Seed</I>) that &ldquo;men begin
with acts, not with thoughts.&rdquo; Sumner was trying to define his
own neologism, &ldquo;folkways,&rdquo; which referred to &ldquo;&rsquo;usages,
manners, customs, mores and morals&rsquo; which he believed to be
practiced more or less unconsciously in every culture.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote1anc" HREF="bellcult.html#sdendnote1sym"><SUP>i</SUP></A></SUP>
Thus Sumner&rsquo;s &ldquo;folkways&rdquo; correspond more or less
exactly to Tocqueville&rsquo;s <I>moeurs</I>. Fischer, on the other
hand, insists that &ldquo;in the modern world a folkway is apt to be
a cultural <I>artifact&mdash;</I>the conscious instrument of human
will and purpose. Often &hellip; it is also the deliberate
contrivance of a cultural elite.&rdquo; David Bell, I think, would
agree with David Fischer, whereas Tocqueville would tend to be rather
more skeptical about the malleability of humankind. Hence Tocqueville
would recommend that we attend more to forms, rituals, and practices
and less to images and words.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">These reflections lead
me naturally to my second theme, which is the so-called linguistic
turn in historiography. No one has written more eloquently or
forcefully on this topic than David Bell himself:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">One
of the stranger results of the &ldquo;linguistic turn&rdquo; in our
discipline has been to make a great deal of actual history sound
suspiciously like a graduate seminar. Today, historical actors are
always being described as inventing concepts, attributing meanings,
and developing understandings. They are seen as producing
representations, telling stories, revising received ideas, and even
working at discourses. They sound, in short, very much like
historians. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">I
have been as guilty of this tendency as anyone else, and on most days
I am ready to defend it to a certain point. Since historical reality
can only be perceived through the veils of linguistic
representations, these representations necessarily constitute our
first object of study. Yet it is also important to recognize that the
tendency has come at a high price. It takes away not only much of the
color and drama of the past, but also much of its strangeness. By
boiling down so much of historical action to a species of mental
work, we make it seem deceptively familiar. Very few people in
history have spent quite so much of their lives as we do manipulating
symbolic concepts. All actions derive their meanings from symbolic
fields, but this obviously does not mean that all actions are <I>solely</I>
symbolic.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote2anc" HREF="bellcult.html#sdendnote2sym"><SUP>ii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Tocqueville shared
David&rsquo;s uneasiness as to precisely what language is capable of
revealing about the deepest roots of human action: mores, tastes,
habits of the mind and heart. He was particularly skeptical of
abstract words and conceptual language and of course saw the penchant
for resorting to abstraction as a consequence of equality itself,
inasmuch as equality promotes restless unease and constant change:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">Men
who live in democratic countries will therefore often have
vacillating thoughts; they need very broad expressions to contain
them. Since they never know whether the idea to which they are giving
voice today will fit the new situation in which they may find
themselves tomorrow, they naturally develop a taste for abstract
ideas. An abstract word is like a box with a false bottom: you can
put in any ideas you please and take them out again without anyone
being the wiser. (DA II.1.16)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Hence I think it is fair
to say that Tocqueville would have been skeptical of the linguistic
turn in historiography. To understand something as deeply rooted as
the cult of the nation, he would have found words, particularly
abstract words, insufficient. He would have wanted to look beyond
words to mentalities, traditions, states of mind, unspoken emotions,
<I>partis pris</I>, and much else for which substantial evidence is
hard to come by. Words simply do not cut deep enough. Just how much
confidence can we place, then, in the distinctions we draw among
abstractions? Let us assume that <I>patrie</I> was indeed as David
tells us it was, &ldquo;a variable and contradictory term,&rdquo; yet
that it had &ldquo;one very clear set of associations with the
ancient Greek and Roman republics,&rdquo; whereas <I>civilisation</I>,
by contrast, &ldquo;stretched across political boundaries and carried
with it a sense of historical progress,&rdquo; while <I>soci&eacute;t&eacute;</I>
was &ldquo;a virtual synonym for <I>patrie</I>, complete with
resonances of decline.&rdquo; [40-41] A Tocquevillean, or for that
matter a Popperian, might well ask what would count as a
falsification of assertions such as these, since one could of course
adduce passages from eighteenth-century texts in which, for instance,
<I>soci&eacute;t&eacute;</I> is not a virtual synonym of <I>patrie</I>
and carries no connotation of decline. Perhaps, in the end, it makes
no difference whether the distinctions delineated here inhere in the
past, as adepts of the linguistic turn would maintain, or are imposed
on the past in order to make sense of it, but I sometimes have
trouble keeping clear in my mind which kind of argument is being
made. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">A second and related
remark has to do with the range of sources to which linguistic
analysis is applied. Linguistic-turn historians often seem drawn as
if by pre-established harmony to relatively obscure pamphleteers,
neglected poets, unsung iconographers, and publishing entrepreneurs
such as Jean Du Castre d&rsquo;Auvigny, whose contribution to the
cult of great men David reveals to excellent effect. It is certainly
an understandable and laudable impulse of scholarly ambition to want
to explore what has lain for centuries in obscurity, to uncover what
we do not already know. And there are good theoretical reasons for
looking beyond canonical texts: it may even be true that one must
know a good deal about <I>le degr&eacute; z&eacute;ro de l&rsquo;&eacute;criture</I>
in order to interpret the great texts properly. Yet Tocqueville, I
think, would have asked what weight we are entitled to attach to such
discoveries. Assiduous avoidance of the familiar can make the
relatively unfamiliar loom disproportionately large. The literature
and iconography surrounding the death of Jumonville are fascinating,
but the institutional role of the army in forging the nation may be
of greater moment. What Jean Soanen preached about &ldquo;order and
harmony&rdquo; tells us something about the transfer of religious
values to the secular sphere, but it might also be useful to learn
how the various terms clustering around <I>nation</I> resonated
against the sounding board of mercantilist thought. The imagery and
poetry growing out of the English-French rivalry cast the two nations
in a new and interesting light, but the economic aspects of their
competition come in for less attention in David&rsquo;s book, perhaps
because they cannot be neatly fitted into the its implicit
chronology, which emphasizes a radical <I>coupure</I> in &ldquo;the
decades around 1700&rdquo; [27, 33].</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">With the mention of the
once-chic term <I>coupure</I>, we come to my third and final point,
the matter of chronology. Even Tocqueville succumbs at times to the
wish to see bright lines in ancient texts: &ldquo;The word <I>patrie</I>
was not used by French authors before the sixteenth century.&rdquo;
[DA, II.3.18] Yet such flat statements of <I>rupture </I>are rare in
his work; he is more drawn to metaphors of diffusion and blending, of
ripening and maturation, than to the images of breaking and rending
that Foucault made fashionable. (Parenthetically and somewhat
pedantically, I might add that to cite Foucault as the emblem of a
sharp break in historical writing is itself a kind of Foucaldian
fallacy, inasmuch as Foucault&rsquo;s rhetoric of discontinuity was
anticipated by Gaston Bachelard and Georges Canguilhem, to say
nothing of Thomas Kuhn. But I digress.) <I>Chiaroscuro</I>
historiography can indeed help to restore something of the &ldquo;color,
drama, &hellip; and strangeness&rdquo; of the past that David fears
partisans of the linguistic turn often neglect to their detriment.
Like <I>chiaroscuro</I> painting, however, the Foucaldian dramaturgy
is a method of contrasts. All of its rhetorical devices are aimed at
heightening contrast; little interest is evinced in subtle shadings,
gradations, or causal mechanisms. Once, while attending a concert at
Boston&rsquo;s Symphony Hall and observing the audience in the pit
from the balcony above, I was moved to reflect that history on
Foucault&rsquo;s reading is like a hall full of concert-goers: first
there are small knots of people locked in conversation, drawn
together by their elective affinities and similarities, like the
pre-modern <I>episteme</I> as Foucault describes it; then there are
orderly ranks of silent music-lovers, faces raptly intent on the
conductor&rsquo;s raised baton. The contrast between the two states
is clear; by bracketing the cause of the transition from one kind of
order to another, the observer frees himself to embroider at will
upon <I>la diff&eacute;rence</I>.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">David, despite his
insistence on a sharp break around 1700, is properly critical of
Foucault, and more particularly of Keith Baker and Quentin Skinner,
whom he sees as influenced by Foucault, for failing &ldquo;to
elucidate a broader social and cultural context to which the changing
meanings of words ultimately relate, even if they do not reflect it
in any simple sense.&rdquo; [n. 69, p. 227] His text succeeds in
making good on this implicit promise to supply not just a context but
a causal framework. Yet he is also very much a historian of his
generation&mdash;younger than mine&mdash;a generation brought up to
distrust the idea that the formation of national consciousness could
be &ldquo;an almost literal process of construction, involving bricks
and mortar, iron track and copper wire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Copper wire&rdquo;
might seem a bit anachronistic here; it is included, perhaps, to
remind us of Lenin&rsquo;s misbegotten equation: &ldquo;communism
equals soviet power plus electrification.&rdquo; Yet even if we
eschew such vulgar materialism, we can all surely agree with David
that &ldquo;brick, wire, and track, not to mention newspapers and
administrative circulars,&rdquo; need not be relegated to &ldquo;history&rsquo;s
dustbin.&rdquo; [33] To acknowledge, as David does, the importance of
the material organization of society as well as its linguistic
representation is to make room for a full appreciation of the heroic
<I>d&eacute;senclavement</I>&mdash;to borrow a word from Daniel
Roche, the historian of <I>La France des Lumi&egrave;res</I>&mdash;that
made a nation out of a congeries of <I>pays</I> and <I>terroirs</I>,
of <I>&eacute;tats provinciaux</I> and <I>parlements de province</I>,
of consumers of butter, <I>schmalz de canard</I>, and olive oil. It
was not just the building of roads and canals that knitted the
country together; it was, among other things, the administrative
surveys, royal commissions, committees of enlightened correspondents,
emulators of fashion, and keepers-up with the Espinasses and
Geoffrins, those Joneses of the Republic of Letters. It was
conscripts and heroes and adepts of <I>la cour</I> as well as <I>la
ville</I>. It was the fault not only of Voltaire and Rousseau and all
the countless <I>Rousseau du ruisseau</I> but of Colbert and
Richelieu and Turgot and Necker&mdash;familiar names, perhaps, but in
our sophistication we are in danger, sometimes, of not giving the
familiar its due.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">David Bell&rsquo;s
distinctive study gives new depth to the cult of the nation in
France. It is a first step toward reconstructing that cult in the
round, as it were. David stimulates our interest in learning more
about how the lexicon of nation-talk was deployed in areas he hasn&rsquo;t
been able to explore: in the military, for example; in business and
commerce; in the administration. We owe him a debt of gratitude for
having turned our curiosity in new directions.</P>
