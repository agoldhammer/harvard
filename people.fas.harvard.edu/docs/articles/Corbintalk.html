</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">I want to talk about the
two works of Alain Corbin&rsquo;s that I know best because I
translated them, <I>The Life of an Unknown</I> and <I>The Village of
Cannibals.</I> This might seem at first sight too limited a sample to
shed much light on the oeuvre of a historian noted among other things
for his astonishing range. Yet these two works serve admirably, I
think, to demonstrate that range because they exemplify polar
extremes of Corbin&rsquo;s historical gaze. One reconstructs a murder
that takes place in the village of Hautefaye in 1870; the other
recovers the lost world of a forgotten man who, as it happens, died
within a few years of that event.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">The former work is thus
a study of what Corbin calls, in the preface to the latter, &ldquo;a
fortuitous event&rdquo; that casts &ldquo;a brief and lurid light on
the myriads of the disappeared.&rdquo; But such events were, as
Corbin reminds us, &ldquo;exceptional, products of a paroxysm
offering momentary access to an underlying reality without telling us
much about the torpor of ordinary existences.&rdquo; <I>The torpor of
ordinary existences</I>: the phrase is striking, and it is not only
an apt description of the life of Louis-Fran&ccedil;ois Pinagot but
also an important clue to what Corbin believed was missing from the
reigning schools of French historiography. He set out to remedy that
lack by creating a distinctive new style of historical writing, and
the success of this bold wager is of course the reason we are here.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">I emphasize historical
<I>writing</I> because among contemporary French historians Corbin is
surely one of the best writers. He explores territory where chiefly
poets and novelists had gone before: the sensory and the sensual, the
nocturnal, the violent, the mundane. Yet his use of literary genre is
never conventional. Indeed, he obliges writers to think in new ways
about literary genres just as much as he challenges historians to
think in new ways about their subject matter and craft.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Corbin&rsquo;s use of
literary genre is careful and deliberate. In <I>The Village of
Cannibals</I> he alludes often to the &ldquo;tragedy&rdquo; of
Hautefaye and cleverly plays off attributes of that genre by
emphasizing the &ldquo;blindness&rdquo; of both the protagonist and
the antagonist, the implacability of the forces that pit one against
the other, and the tragic flaw in social representations stemming
from what he calls &ldquo;anthropological otherness.&rdquo; I shall
come back to this, because I think that Corbin&rsquo;s insistence on
the tragic consequences of this anthropological distance is one of
the most important lessons he has to teach.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">As for the Pinagot saga,
the literary genre it most nearly resembles in scope and magnitude
and impressiveness is the epic, yet the feats it recounts are
anti-heroic rather than heroic. Pinagot, the protagonist, belongs to
the lowest stratum of rural society, yet his chronicler expresses a
rather critical view of the traditional practice of &ldquo;history
from the bottom up&rdquo;: he wants &ldquo;to stand the methods of
nineteenth-century social history on their head&rdquo; because even
popular social history had all too often been &ldquo;based on the
study of a very small sample, of people whose fates were
exceptional.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote1anc" HREF="Corbintalk.html#sdendnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A></SUP>
These popular &ldquo;heroes&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;militant witnesses&rdquo;
of the past, Corbin calls them&mdash;are precisely those who have
shaken off the &ldquo;torpor of existence&rdquo; to create
&ldquo;destinies&rdquo; for themselves, whereas the kind of man that
interests the historian is the one for whom such an exalted thing as
a destiny was beyond conceiving.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">So Pinagot is an
anti-hero rather than a hero, yet at this very basic level of
existence, this degree zero of humanity, one senses in Corbin a
profound respect for a different kind of heroism, a heroism that is
not at all &ldquo;militant,&rdquo; a heroism that might be called the
heroism of endurance. To endure, without a voice, with barely a
murmur, leaving the merest trace of one&rsquo;s passage on this
earth, is if not the destiny then at least the lot of most of
mankind. Those whose lives are feats of endurance live their allotted
time only to vanish without a trace. To live in the sure knowledge
that all memory of one&rsquo;s existence will be &ldquo;abolished&rdquo;
is, Corbin suggests, a distinctive kind of heroism, a heroism worthy
of its own kind of epic.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">The literariness of
Corbin&rsquo;s history extends to the substance as well as form. His
&ldquo;return to narrative&rdquo; is not merely a means of making
palatable the otherwise indigestible results of historical &ldquo;science.&rdquo;
It is rather history as <I>resistance</I>: resistance to the
imperious claims of the present, which&mdash;however comprehensibly,
however justifiably&mdash;cannot help but seek to appropriate the
past to its own purposes, be they political, administrative,
commemorative, or foundational. The late Fran&ccedil;ois Furet gave
the definitive statement of the contrary orthodoxy at the beginning
of his essay on &ldquo;Tocqueville and the French Revolution.&rdquo;
Tocqueville, Furet wrote, &ldquo;was not one of those historians with
a penchant for losing themselves in the mists of time or for the
poetry of the past or for the diversions of scholarship; his
historical curiosity was of another type entirely, in which
reflection on the present served as the starting point of a quest for
antecedents.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote2anc" HREF="Corbintalk.html#sdendnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Corbin took the risk&mdash;and
it was a substantial risk, I think, when he first charted his
course&mdash;of sailing against this wind. Or, rather, these winds:
for the winds of academic orthodoxy did not always blow out of the
same quarter. From whichever direction they came, however&mdash;the
liberal center, the Marxist or non-Marxist left, the religious or
Orleanist or post-Marxist right, or one or another social movement:
<I>soixante-huitard</I>, <I>MDF</I>, <I>syndicaliste</I>,
<I>autogestionnaire</I>&mdash;their force was considerable. It is no
secret that the methods of the history of the <I>longue dur&eacute;e</I>&mdash;the
statistical series, the voluminous compilations of trade tonnages,
transhumance headcounts, and the like&mdash;were also the tools of
economic planning and the <I>dirigiste</I> state. Even the history of
<I>mentalit&eacute;s</I>&mdash;the culturalist reaction to the more
unalloyed economism and demographism of some <I>Annales</I>
history&mdash;was often obliged to pursue the bottom up from the top
down: Le Goff read confessors&rsquo; manuals to get at how the
faithful in the parishes conceived of sin, and Duby plumbed the
theoretical speculations of highly placed clerics for clues to how
the three orders of medieval society related to one another.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote3anc" HREF="Corbintalk.html#sdendnote3sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A></SUP>
Yet if social history often sharpened its defective eyesight by
donning bureaucratic spectacles, it frequently tinted those
spectacles with one or another of the rosy shades of solidarity.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Whether <I>engagement</I>
does or does not distort the past is, for Corbin, a moot point, for
the past that seems most meaningful to the politically committed
historian is not the past that engages him. Of Pinagot, for instance,
he says&mdash;with, I think, discernable pride&mdash;that this is &ldquo;a
man to whom I have no emotional ties, with whom I share no <I>a
priori</I> faith or mission or commitment.&rdquo; And we may take it
for granted that, however thoroughly he elucidates the <I>logic</I>
behind the murder of Alain de Mon&eacute;ys, he has no wish to
associate himself with the brutality of the act. Indeed, he even
allows himself to be mildly disparaging of the all too facile
solidarities engendered by question-begging identification with the
beleaguered of the past: what, he wonders, might &ldquo;that
collective entity known as &lsquo;the people&rsquo;&rdquo; have
thought of the &ldquo;studies of &lsquo;working-class language,&rsquo;
&lsquo;women&rsquo;s language,&rsquo; and the &lsquo;literature of
the excluded&rsquo;&rdquo; that &ldquo;since the late 1960s
publishers have delighted in publishing?&rdquo;</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">I may even be
understating Corbin&rsquo;s resistance to <I>l&rsquo;histoire
engag&eacute;e</I>, for did he not write in <I>The Village of
Cannibals</I> that history &ldquo;obsessed with the need to
distinguish sharply between the good and the wicked&rdquo; leads to
&ldquo;uncritical&rdquo; misrepresentation? And, further, that
historians &ldquo;lost interest&rdquo; in the crime at Hautefaye
&ldquo;when they found that it could not be explained in terms of the
same political divisions they used to make sense of the larger
society?&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote4anc" HREF="Corbintalk.html#sdendnote4sym"><SUP>4</SUP></A></SUP>
To be sure, he is writing here of nineteenth-century historians,
republican ideologues, who feared &ldquo;soiling the pages of history
with the stuff of reality.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote5anc" HREF="Corbintalk.html#sdendnote5sym"><SUP>5</SUP></A></SUP>
But the point carries over, <I>mutatis mutandis</I>, to his own
contemporaries. It is simple but profound: there is more to life than
politics. The consequences of this point&mdash;which Corbin makes
quietly, almost by the way, merely by choosing to focus his attention
where he does&mdash;are far-reaching.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm"><I>There is more to life
than politics.</I> Might not the smells and sounds hidden in what
Furet rather peremptorily dismissed as &ldquo;the poetry of the past&rdquo;
be essential to a fuller understanding of history as it really was?
Historians limit their capacity to paint the past when they work with
the too broad brush of political history. Yet how fine a brush can
they use and still achieve something more than a miniature? How,
moreover, should that brush be wielded? A la Monet, Seurat, or Van
Gogh? Should the historian paint the cathedral in every possible
light, or the haystack? The torpor of existence on a Sunday at La
Grande Jatte? Or the forgotten postman who would otherwise have
vanished without a trace? If the very variety of the historian&rsquo;s
styles is a measure of his mastery, what sort of coherence can we
expect to emerge from such remarkable versatility?</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Corbin is clear about
the limits of what is possible. The coherence he seeks is not at the
level of the individual sensibility. He does not claim to be writing
biography, much less interior monologue. In the notes from his diary
included in the Pinagot book, he remarks that &ldquo;it is quite
risky even to speak of individuality in this context.&rdquo; I became
aware of Corbin&rsquo;s caution in this regard when I proposed, as a
title for the English translation of the Pinagot book, <I>Biography
of an Unknown</I>, which for me held some of the allure of the
paradoxical. Corbin resisted this suggestion with a cogent argument:
&ldquo;In fact, the book tries to show that biography (a genre whose
legitimacy is any case problematic) is impossible when it comes to
nearly any individual who lived in the past. What is possible is
simply to evoke the world in which the individual evolved, assuming
that he or she did not belong to an elite capable of leaving
individual traces, to attempt to see with his or her eyes by acting
as a sort of subjective camera.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote6anc" HREF="Corbintalk.html#sdendnote6sym"><SUP>6</SUP></A></SUP>
We find the same camera imagery in a passage of Corbin&rsquo;s diary:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">My
procedure will resemble that of a filmmaker who shoots a scene
through the eyes of a character who remains off screen. I must do
everything I can to reconstitute his spatial and temporal horizon,
his family environment, his circle of friends, his community, as well
as his probable values and beliefs. I must try to imagine his
pleasures and pains, his worries, his bouts of anger, and his dreams.
I will need to conjure up an image in the round from the shape of the
mold, from what the very silence surrounding my quarry reveals.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">As ambitious as this
program is, it is different from biography in that it conceives its
subject and its subject&rsquo;s subjectivity as individual only in
the sense that atoms are individual: in approaching Pinagot, the
historian tells us, &ldquo;it was necessary to choose at random one
of a myriad of identical social atoms. There was no other way to
honor with remembrance a unique individual from an undifferentiated
mass.&rdquo; As in physics, the behavior of such an atom can be
understood only by observing how it moves in the various fields of
force that act on it.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">But why, if one shares
&ldquo;no <I>a priori</I> faith or mission or commitment&rdquo; with
that &ldquo;undifferentiated mass,&rdquo; would one choose to devote
&ldquo;several years&rdquo; of one&rsquo;s professional life to &ldquo;a
stranger&rdquo; for whom one feels &ldquo;no special affection or
empathy?&rdquo; The answer, I think, has several dimensions. The
first might be termed ethnographic: the life of a specimen subject
like Pinagot &ldquo;holds the potential to reveal a range of emotion
and a variety of human experience, owing to his longevity, the extent
of his family, the variety of roles he played and places he lived,
and the diverse nature of employment in the woodworking trade.&rdquo;
A similar case can be made for interest in the <I>fait divers</I> of
Hautefaye: the variety of human experience, even the most bestial of
human experience, is intrinsically interesting.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">The second dimension has
to do with the historian&rsquo;s duty of fidelity. It is a stark and
inescapable fact that most people then as now vanish from this earth
without a trace. Historians can hide from this fact by saying that
their task is to write the history of &ldquo;economies, societies,
and civilizations,&rdquo; not of &ldquo;myriads of identical social
atoms.&rdquo; Corbin, however, seems troubled by such a choice. While
he may feel &ldquo;no special affection&rdquo; for Louis-Fran&ccedil;ois
Pinagot, something very deep in him is stirred by the thought of
those vast legions of the eternally anonymous. For him, writing about
a man like Pinagot was indeed the only</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">&hellip;
way to honor with remembrance a unique individual from an
undifferentiated mass. Anyone whose fate was unusual in any way, who
left an unusual record of any kind, had to be eliminated. Anyone who
had not been totally forgotten, even by his descendants, had to be
ruled out. It was essential to choose a person about whom the only
documentary record would consist of materials not brought to light by
a specific interest in <I>that</I> individual.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Note the phrase &ldquo;to
honor with remembrance&rdquo;: not every historian would regard this
as part of his duty to the past. We may take it, then, as a token of
the specific historical sensibility of Alain Corbin that he does feel
such a duty to the silent majority of the dead.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Another aspect of
Corbin&rsquo;s sensibility is respect for simplicity: &ldquo;The men
and women of the milieu and generation to which my still unchosen
subject belonged were generally quite hostile toward anyone who put
on airs or aspired to leave some trace of his or her existence.&rdquo;
He wants to &ldquo;imagine the social hierarchy as seen from below.&rdquo;
His humility is at times edged with atonement: in earlier work, he
says, he had failed to notice the &ldquo;logic of the peasants&rsquo;
position&rdquo; owing to his &ldquo;failure to attend, carefully, and
without preconceptions, to what people did and said.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote7anc" HREF="Corbintalk.html#sdendnote7sym"><SUP>7</SUP></A></SUP>
It is as if the historian who clings to &ldquo;scientific&rdquo;
methods forecloses access to his subject in much the same way that
the bourgeois with his air of prosperous respectability reduces to
silence or stammering awkwardness the peasant with whom he transacts
business. Thus he contrasts the agricultural show at Nontron, which
provided &ldquo;an occasion for rural society to honor its own
hierarchy,&rdquo; with the fairground at Hautefaye, &ldquo;a place
where peasants could hear their own voices and mingle with their own
kind. There was no need for restraint or feigned humility or
deference.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote8anc" HREF="Corbintalk.html#sdendnote8sym"><SUP>8</SUP></A></SUP>
Corbin wants to see the peasant not on his best behavior but, as
Mallarm&eacute; wished to see Poe, &ldquo;tel qu&rsquo;en lui-m&ecirc;me
enfin l&rsquo;&eacute;ternit&eacute; le change,&rdquo; except that
here it is not <I>l&rsquo;&eacute;ternit&eacute;</I> but <I>l&rsquo;anonymit&eacute;</I>
that effects the transfiguration: &ldquo;The comparative anonymity of
the participants [in the fair], the unlikelihood of encountering
people one knew well, created conditions in which people felt free to
behave with unaccustomed lack of restraint.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote9anc" HREF="Corbintalk.html#sdendnote9sym"><SUP>9</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Ethnographic color,
respectful fidelity, transfigurative simplicity: these are three
aspects of Alain Corbin&rsquo;s literary-historical sensibility. But
there is another aspect, which I think is revealed more fully in the
two books about which I have chosen to speak than in any of his other
works. It is less easy to ascribe a name to this fourth aspect of
Corbin&rsquo;s temperament, yet if obliged to do so I think I would
call it &ldquo;religious awe.&rdquo; Anyone who finds such a
characterization excessive would do well to pay close attention to
Corbin&rsquo;s description of his Pinagot project as a
&ldquo;resurrection&rdquo;:  
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">No
resurrection can be anything other than a prelude to ultimate
erasure. Conversely, every disappearance presupposes a spectator. As
much as the ineluctability of death it is this certainty of vanishing
without a trace which accounts for the persistence over the millennia
of our sense of the vanity of all things. It was this certainty that
gave rise to the idea of the Last Judgment as a vast historical
canvas in which every person&rsquo;s past would be recapitulated in
its entirety. Nevertheless, what moves us most profoundly is not the
fact that virtually all the denizens of the prehistoric and historic
past have vanished without a trace but that such has also been the
fate of people relatively close to us in time.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Resurrection, ultimate
erasure, ineluctability of death, vanity of all things, Last
Judgment: with his very diction Corbin takes us into a realm where
few other historians have ventured. His is a deeply anti-teleological
reading of history: there is no final cause, only finality&mdash;the
finality of life itself. Life for most human beings has no purpose,
meaning, or direction. It is simply there, to be enjoyed at times, at
other times to be endured, and then it is gone. Hence we cannot fully
or properly understand the past if we attempt to impose meaning on it
retrospectively:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">In
the course of trying to understand [Pinagot], I came to believe that
what mattered most in shaping his perception of time was the need to
survive. He suffered through a series of intense crises during which
meeting basic biological needs must have required his full attention.
Of course this is only conjecture on my part, but I feel on firmer
ground in proposing the calendar of famines as a chronological
framework for Louis-Fran&ccedil;ois&rsquo;s existence than I would
in, say, ticking off a series of political regimes.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote10anc" HREF="Corbintalk.html#sdendnote10sym"><SUP>10</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Yet Corbin, for all that
he rejects the political as a suitable framework for conceptualizing
a life lived at the degree zero of existence, is also a product of
French historiography and French history, hence he cannot ignore the
fact that elites were constantly attempting to impose purposes,
meanings, and directions of their own on lives that had none. Indeed,
the contrast between the historically conscious, for whom history has
a destination, and the historically unconscious, who simply put one
foot in front of another as they creep in their petty pace from day
to day, is for Corbin a fundamental feature of social life. One sees
this clearly in his account of the trial that follows the murder at
Hautefaye.  Those for whom history since the Enlightenment was
supposed to have marked progress toward tolerance of difference,
mildness of manner, and horror at human suffering simply could not
comprehend the murderers&rsquo; indifference to their victim&rsquo;s
pain: &ldquo;Clearly,&rdquo; Corbin says, &ldquo;an abyss separated
two systems of representing pain, two criteria, two scales of
suffering. In other words, two contrasting sensibilities met in court
in December 1870.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote11anc" HREF="Corbintalk.html#sdendnote11sym"><SUP>11</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Precisely what role is
to be assigned to this clash of sensibilities in Corbin&rsquo;s
vision of history? Is it, as class conflict was for Marx, an
explanatory engine? I doubt that Corbin would claim that he knows
what makes history move. In fact, I suspect that he would deem any
such claim to be a form of self-deception. Self-deception as to the
possibility of knowing the course of history was perhaps the
characteristic blindness of a certain nineteenth-century elite:
republican, progressive, positivist, <I>s&ucirc;r de lui et
dominateur</I>: afraid &ldquo;of soiling the pages of history with
the stuff of reality &hellip; fastidious and fearful historians
appear to have conspired with the men of the time to cover up
horrific events.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote12anc" HREF="Corbintalk.html#sdendnote12sym"><SUP>12</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">For Corbin the clash of
sensibilities between this elite, which sees history from on high and
thinks it perceives its beginning and end, and men like Pinagot or
the villagers of Hautefaye reveals a rapid psychological shift. The
elite is already living in the future and does not wish to be
detained by the unruliness of the present; it no longer feels or
perceives what the murderers of Mon&eacute;ys felt and perceived.
That is why the event struck contemporaries as so &ldquo;bizarre,&rdquo;
as &ldquo;tantamount &hellip; to a denial of the nineteenth
century.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote13anc" HREF="Corbintalk.html#sdendnote13sym"><SUP>13</SUP></A></SUP>
The historian has a striking image for this peculiar survival of an
outmoded sensibility: he calls it a &ldquo;monadnock,&rdquo; from a
term that geographers use &ldquo;to refer to an isolated hill or
mountain of resistant rock that juts up from a surrounding plain as
witness to the geological past.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote14anc" HREF="Corbintalk.html#sdendnote14sym"><SUP>14</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">The locomotive of
history versus the monadnock: detour is inevitable when the past so
unexpectedly blocks the direct route to the future. We see now the
tragic element in Corbin&rsquo;s historic vision: what divides the
elite&rsquo;s vision from the Hautefaye peasant&rsquo;s is precisely
the consciousness of a destination, a destiny, a goal toward which
action in the present is directed. The peasant is born and expects to
die in the monadnock&rsquo;s shadow. His world changes slowly, and he
is too preoccupied with the struggle for survival to devote much
thought to it. He is burdened by what Corbin calls &ldquo;the inertia
of representations.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote15anc" HREF="Corbintalk.html#sdendnote15sym"><SUP>15</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">We thus arrive at an
interesting division of the human race. There are those who live in
history, conscious that the human world is a theater of constant and
rapid change, and those in whom history lives&mdash;lives, at any
rate, in the form of inert representations, remnants of a vanished
past. Some of the former will try to inflect or master the processes
of change in accordance with the theories they form of them.
Historians, professional students of these processes, find it almost
too easy to wed their point of view. By contrast, the latter&mdash;those
in whom history lives as opposed to those who live in and for and
through history&mdash;experience change as an alien threat because
their vision of the world continues to be shaped by the inertia of
representations. So long as this threat does not impinge too directly
on their world, on the &ldquo;torpor of existence&rdquo; in which
they pursue their daily round, they are content to eye it warily. But
when it draws too near, torpor, inertia, and incomprehension can
explode into violence. This is what happened at Hautefaye.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">The image of the
nineteenth century that Corbin gives us in these two books is at
first sight rather strange and disconcerting. The familiar pageant of
political history takes on an air of unreality. It is reduced to a
flimsy, painted backdrop, as was in fact the case in any number of
local festivals.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote16anc" HREF="Corbintalk.html#sdendnote16sym"><SUP>16</SUP></A></SUP>
Revolutions, restorations, and wars are like distant thunderstorms
that only occasionally buffet the localities on which our attention
is fixed. The rumble of cannon reaches our ears only muffled by the
thickness of the forest of Bell&ecirc;me. The transformation of the
economy is glimpsed only through its indirect impact on timbering
regulations, demand for wooden shoes, tax increases affecting the
local peasantry, and what not. Yet the very meticulousness of
Corbin&rsquo;s reconstruction reminds us that life in the remote
backwaters was no less real than life in the metropolitan centers.
The souls that languished in the torpor of rural existence are no
less deserving of a place in the great historical canvas of the Last
Judgment than those that manned the barricades or crowded the stock
exchanges or toiled in the factories.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">In a striking way,
Corbin&rsquo;s nineteenth century, which may have seemed somewhat
quaint and exotic when he first began assembling the elements of his
tableau, has of late taken on a new and more somber relevance. For
the nineteenth century was a time when powerful economic currents
swept through <I>la France profonde</I>, isolating islands here and
there and exposing the monadnocks of the past that most obdurately
resisted change. Today those same currents, fed by a vastly greater
number of tributaries, are sweeping not just rural France but the
entire globe. Islands of resistance have not been slow to appear. The
confident historical vision of metropolitan elites has not failed to
mystify and disconcert and anger communities that had hitherto been
content to suffer the torpor of their existence in silence. And here
and there, as in Hautefaye, the inertia of representations has led to
paroxysmal eruptions of violence against imagined enemies. To the
metropolitan eye, the equations by which these enemies have been
defined seem as bizarre as the amalgam that designated Alain de
Mon&eacute;ys as a fit victim in the eyes of his persecutors: he was
an aristocrat, <I>hence</I> a wealthy landlord, <I>hence</I> a
bourgeois republican lining his pockets with the corrupt booty of a
republic implacably opposed to that friend of the peasant, the
emperor, <I>hence</I> objectively an ally of the Prussian invader. I
will refrain from deconstructing &agrave; la Corbin the equally
peculiar logic that designates the New York bond salesman as a fit
victim in the eyes of the <I>mujahadeen</I>.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Those whom history in
its haste would brusquely shove aside have a way of commanding the
attention of those who would prefer to ignore them. It is not the
least of Corbin&rsquo;s virtues that he reminds us of this at a time
when we are in danger, as the historian puts it, of exaggerating &ldquo;the
anthropological distance&rdquo; between ourselves and those whom we
would relegate to &ldquo;what Edgar Quinet once called the &lsquo;desert
of dread.&rsquo;&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote17anc" HREF="Corbintalk.html#sdendnote17sym"><SUP>17</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Of course Corbin himself
would be the first to remind me of the dubiousness of this kind of
analogy: &ldquo;The need to distinguish sharply between the good and
the wicked &hellip; has led to an uncritical confounding of unrelated
massacres. &hellip; Attempts to trace the evolution of collective
sensibilities have been rejected out of hand.&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote18anc" HREF="Corbintalk.html#sdendnote18sym"><SUP>18</SUP></A></SUP>
Here, at last, is an answer to the question I posed earlier: where
should we look to find the coherence of the many styles that Corbin
has brought to the writing of history? To the &ldquo;evolution of
collective sensibilities,&rdquo; a subject worthy of all the finesse
that Alain Corbin has brought to it.</P>
