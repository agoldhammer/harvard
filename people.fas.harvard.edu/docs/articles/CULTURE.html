Culture, let us be clear, is not <I>le fait du Prince</I>. The
<I>Zeitgeist</I> does not progress at the rhythm of the <I>septennat</I>.
Still, the end of the Mitterrand era is a convenient place to take
stock. Over the past fourteen years the French cultural landscape has
changed more rapidly and dramatically perhaps than the countryside
itself. It is a quieter place, for one thing: the &ldquo;silence of
the intellectuals&rdquo; was noted soon after the new president took
office. In retrospect that silence was ominous: it signaled
hollowness at the very core of victory. What seemed a triumph of the
Left in 1981 turned out to be the ultimate triumph of de Gaulle: the
<I>coup d&rsquo;&Eacute;tat </I>had proved permanent indeed. And with
that discovery French <I>political</I> culture returned to earth: no
longer was the battle between Right and Left a struggle over the
future of civilization. For all of Mitterrand&rsquo;s efforts to
inflate or conflate policy with poetry, politics had taken a fatally
prosaic turn. The intellectual class turned its attention elsewhere.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm; margin-bottom: 0.64cm; line-height: 0.49cm">
The consequent dedramatization of political life was anticipated and
abetted by the demise of Marxism. This was of course a phenomenon of
<I>longue dur&eacute;e</I>, certainly well under way even as Marxism
was being declared <I>l&rsquo;horizon ind&eacute;passable</I> of
modern times. Indeed, it was perhaps <I>because</I> Marxism was for a
time not only <I>ind&eacute;passable</I> but stiflingly ubiquitous
that its demise became inevitable: there had always been an essential
element of provocation in the French intellectual&rsquo;s embrace of
the communist idea, at least since Aragon&rsquo;s riposte to Drieu la
Rochelle that &ldquo;<I>je braillerai [vive L&eacute;nine] demain,
<U>puisqu&rsquo;on m&rsquo;interdit ce cri</U></I>.&rdquo; What was
no longer <I>interdit</I> but commonplace was no longer worth braying
about. By the time Mitterrand took office, Marxism had ceased to be
of interest to philosophers: Foucault in 1965 had declared it a
strange fish at home nowhere but in nineteenth-century waters. By
1981 it had become Breton&rsquo;s <I>poisson soluble</I>: because it
explained too much in retrospect and too little in prospect it was of
no <I>epistemological</I> interest, and epistemology was all the rage
in the time of the Programme Commun, which not even Marxism but only
the prospect of presidential elections could explain and which in
retrospect has to be seen as one of the more vacuous manifestations
of a moribund political culture. A more serious, if paradoxical,
index of Marxism&rsquo;s fatal weakness was its apparent strength
among social historians. Class had become a routine analytical tool
for <I>Annalistes</I> trained under Labrousse, but its exclusively
<I>descriptive</I> use in structuralist social history, which saw its
goal as correlating social structures with cultural, political, and
ideological differences, sapped the locomotive of history of its
steam. Marxism, which was supposed to tell those who had only thought
about the world how to change it, had been reduced to a social
portrait painter, and the portraits it so prolifically turned out
bore the distinctive stamp of a <I>school</I>: they no longer had the
power to surprise.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm; margin-bottom: 0.64cm; line-height: 0.49cm">
As it happens, one of Labrousse&rsquo;s students, Fran&ccedil;ois
Furet, identified certain defects in the portrait of the very
revolutionary society that was supposed to have been the prototype of
the genre. Furet&rsquo;s rise to intellectual preeminence is surely
one of the central&mdash;and symptomatic&mdash;themes of French
cultural life in the Mitterrand years. One would have had to have
been a prescient reader of Furet and Richet&rsquo;s <I>La R&eacute;volution
fran&ccedil;aise</I> (1965) to have predicted it: the heresy was then
still framed in a recognizable (Lefebvrian) orthodoxy, though it
certainly did not go unnoticed by Furet&rsquo;s former comrades in
the Party. By the time <I>Penser la R&eacute;volution fran&ccedil;aise</I>
was published in 1978, however, heresy had blossomed into full-blown
apostasy: the social history of the Revolution was now inspired by
Cobban rather than Lefebvre, the ideological glue was Tocqueville
rather than Marx, and the reading of the Terror, though hinged on
Cochin&rsquo;s sociology, probably owed as much to Arendt&rsquo;s
philosophical telescoping of Bolsheviks and Jacobins as to Furet&rsquo;s
experience of French Communism in operation.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm; margin-bottom: 0.64cm; line-height: 0.49cm">
Furet&rsquo;s revision of revolutionary historiography thus
distinguished itself in several ways. It moved revolutionary
political culture to center stage, relegating economic history and
class conflict to the wings. It stood the republican myth on its
head: the Revolution, far from making French history a universal
model of liberation, had left France idiosyncratically vulnerable to
what Furet could only see as the pathology of the revolutionary
mentality. And finally, it was eclectic: French philosophers had been
pillaging foreign treasures for years, but few <I>historians</I> were
as shrewd in their syncretism as Furet. His novel brew captured the
imagination of younger historians tired of the repetitive and
fragmentary results of <I>marxisant </I>social history. He offered a
new reading of the central event of French history that responded to
the belated antitotalitarian concerns of the nascent French human
rights movement (the Nouveaux Philosophes had discovered Solzhenitsyn
in 1977; Glucksmann, moved by the plight of the boat people, brought
Sartre and Aron together to shake hands in 1979, symbolizing the
shift in perspective).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm; margin-bottom: 0.64cm; line-height: 0.49cm">
Furet&rsquo;s success had an institutional as well as an intellectual
dimension. He became president of the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en
Sciences Sociales and later chairman of the Institut Saint-Simon. His
articles appeared regularly in the glossy magazines. With the death
of Raymond Aron he became the incarnation of French liberalism&mdash;a
liberalism now defined more by its antithesis, the temptation of the
revolutionary <I>tabula rasa, </I>than by any positive tradition of
pluralist tolerance. Indeed, Furet <I>naturalized</I> the liberal
tradition in a way that Aron, whose central concern in the Cold War
was foreign policy and whose Atlanticist proclivities left him in an
odd and at times antagonistic relation to Gaullism, had never
succeeded in doing. <I>Mieux vaut avoir tort avec Sartre que raison
avec Aron</I>, the saying went: Sartre was more fun, and that was
where the action was. But by the time of Mitterrand&rsquo;s election,
the <I>gauchistes</I> who had cheered Sartre on his barrelhead at
Billancourt had sobered up. <I>Mieux vaut avoir raison avec Furet
quand m&ecirc;me</I>, they all seemed to say in chorus, and in any
case there simply was no longer any Sartre to err with. Even
Foucault, the last heir apparent to the Sartrean magisterium, had
noted, without evident regret, the demise of <I>le grand intellectuel</I>
in an article published in <I>L&rsquo;Arc</I>. His case was
structural, but soon the &ldquo;great intellectuals&rdquo; were gone
not only structurally but physically: Foucault, Barthes, and Lacan
all passed from the scene early in Mitterrand&rsquo;s term; Althusser
lingered on until 1990 but had long since been <I>hors de combat</I>.
Young Turks attempted to liquidate <I>la pens&eacute;e &lsquo;68</I>
anyway, but that dead horse had already decamped for America, where
it led a fitful afterlife in institutions of higher learning and
still figures in our domestic culture wars as Rosinante to a few
deathless Quixotes.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm; margin-bottom: 0.64cm; line-height: 0.49cm">
The vanishing of the &ldquo;great intellectual&rdquo; and the
perceived &ldquo;silence of the intellectuals&rdquo; were of course
related. The silence was in fact figurative: there was no dearth of
intellectual production after 1981, rather an overabundance of it.
What was lacking was a great voice to articulate, as in the past, the
public <I>angst</I> in that distinctively French polyphony of
imagination, wit, and intelligence. Furet, for all his skill, was
only a historian. Thus one witnessed a curious division, for example,
at the time of the Bicentennial of the French Revolution in 1989. The
moment was seen by many observers as that of Furet&rsquo;s
consecration as the reigning intellectual of the hour. &ldquo;He is
everywhere,&rdquo; a friend of mine reported from the scene. A team
of scholars that he and Mona Ozouf assembled produced the definitive
revisionist history of the event, <I>Le Dictionnaire critique de la
R&eacute;volution fran&ccedil;aise</I>. Yet at the level of
<I>l&rsquo;imaginaire</I>, as the French would say, the nation seemed
untouched. The public celebration took little or no account of the
theoried class&rsquo;s loss of confidence in what was being
celebrated. A new historiography was apotheosized, but unlike the
historiography of the <I>Annales</I> it had existential and
imaginative resonance only for those who, like Furet or his disciples
of the &lsquo;68 generation, had experienced the revolutionary
temptation at first hand and found it at first no doubt exhilarating
but ultimately (and perhaps in consequence of that very exhilaration,
that intoxication of the will) frightening.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm; margin-bottom: 0.64cm; line-height: 0.49cm">
This intellectualized containment of the revolutionary or antisocial
drive (Dionysus, become Apollo, recollected green thoughts in a green
shade) is doubly curious when contrasted with another tendency
discernible in the historiography of the Mitterrand years, namely,
the accent on historical <I>memory</I>. The history of memory is a
complex subject, but one thing that all approaches to it seem to
share is a sense that as history and literature have diverged over
the past century, a gap has opened up between the way in which
historians understand the past and the way in which &ldquo;laymen&rdquo;
do. In this dichotomy there is a danger for the clerisy, that of
isolating itself, losing its flock, and ultimately undermining its
<I>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</I>, as well as a danger for the laity,
that of becoming vulnerable to the poisonous mythification of the
past against which the only antidote is some minimal consensus about
what kinds of disagreement, inevitable in historical as opposed to
physical or mathematical science, are <I>reasonable</I>. The history
of memory thus aims, at least in part, to close the gap between
clerisy and laity by restoring a lived <I>inward </I>dimension to the
past: the historian asks not, as Ranke did, what actually happened
but instead what people <I>think</I> happened and how those beliefs
shaped their present and ours. In France, of course, memory was also
a particularly live issue because of Vichy and because the Fifth
Republic was based on a certain memory of a certain idea of France.
Henry Rousso therefore performed a civic service with his exploration
of <I>Le Syndrome de Vichy</I> (1990) and at the same time bestowed a
new respectability on the &ldquo;history of the present,&rdquo; over
which he now exercises official responsibility as the director of the
Institut d&rsquo;Histoire du Temps Pr&eacute;sent. Meanwhile, the
rump of <I>Les Annales</I> also pursued the theme of memory in part
as a palliative, in part as an Ariadne&rsquo;s thread through the
maze left by what Pierre Nora once trumpeted as <I>l&rsquo;&eacute;clatement
de l&rsquo;Histoire</I> only to be chided by a young critic who saw
only <I>l&rsquo;&eacute;miettement</I>. The <I>Ecole des Annales
</I>itself became a kind of memory, to which numerous shrines were
erected in the form of multivolume, multiauthor works on themes such
as rural France, urban France, private life, women, and youth.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm; margin-bottom: 0.64cm; line-height: 0.49cm">
Revisionism, liberalism, the demise of the &ldquo;great
intellectual,&rdquo; and the rise of memory: how do these themes of
the Mitterrand era fit together? Let me throw caution to the
winds&mdash;the genre of &ldquo;instant cultural analysis&rdquo;
fairly demands it&mdash;and suggest an answer. The great intellectual
was a seer, an oracle. Like the Pythia at Delphi, he gathered up the
emanations of the age and issued pronouncements, often in the form of
riddles, in which others presumed to read the future and shaped their
lives according to what they read. What kept the readers reading and
interpreting was a belief, some would say a misplaced faith, that the
future would be, should be, dramatically different from the past.
That faith is gone. Furet&rsquo;s revisionism is a symptom, not a
cause, of its disappearance. The revolutionary <I>tabula rasa</I>, we
are told, was always an illusion&mdash;at first sublime, noble, and
uplifting, later bloody-minded, coercive, and tyrannical. But what,
then, is to be done? The best that can be done, the antirevolutionary
liberal gradualist argues, is what Popper so infelicitously called
&ldquo;piecemeal social engineering.&rdquo; Mend&egrave;s, to whom
Mitterrand paid homage on taking office, put it better: <I>Gouverner,
c&rsquo;est choisir</I>. But is that enough? The problem is that it
leaves liberal societies, shorn of any <I>avenir radieux,</I> with
only memories in lieu of a <I>projet</I>. Nostalgia is mature, wise,
ironic, disillusioned, balanced. Hence it appeals to <I>us</I>,
middle-aged, middle-class <I>gens d&rsquo;&eacute;tude</I>. Others
will not be satisfied. That is cause for concern, indeed for alarm,
as the substantial anti-establishment protest vote in the recent
presidential election makes crystal clear. I do not know how the
challenge can be met, but if my reading of the cultural tea leaves is
correct, then the centrist intellectual consensus exits the
Mitterrand era in much the same condition as the President himself:
still erect, still defiant, but moribund.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm; margin-bottom: 0.64cm; line-height: 0.49cm">
I regret that I have said nothing in this rapid survey about the
novel, poetry, art, architecture, film, theater, dance, or music.
Perhaps the fact that history, and history of a singularly sober,
polemical, and moralistic stripe, is, of all the disciplines and
genres, the one that seems to me to capture most fully the <I>mentalit&eacute;
</I>of the Mitterrand era is itself a feature of the period worth
remarking on; certainly one would not characterize any comparable
expanse of this century by looking at its historians.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm; margin-bottom: 0.64cm; line-height: 0.49cm">
Perhaps, in conclusion, I should say a word about <I>le fait du
Prince</I> <I>proprement dit</I>: <I>les Grands Travaux</I>. The
first point to be made about them is that they are intended, quite
consciously I think, to expand the &ldquo;cultural capital&rdquo;
beyond the traditional invisible <I>enceinte </I>that coincides
roughly with the boundaries of sixteenth-century Paris. From La
Grande Arche in that wholly artificial excrescence of the city that
goes by the name of La D&eacute;fense, to the Science Park on the
edge of what remains the colorful and redolent butchers&rsquo;
district of La Villette, to the Tr&egrave;s Grande Biblioth&egrave;que
that now dominates the gritty quays of the east end, a vast new
triangular Paris of the future has been staked out, with Science,
Letters, and Business at the vertices. The gargantuan and bizarre new
library may have been meant to restore a certain artificial balance
to this triangle: the President often proclaimed his love of
literature even if his practice frequently sacrificed more to
technology and cash. At the center of <I>les Grands Travaux</I> one
finds other triangles: the faces of I. M. Pei&rsquo;s pyramid, to my
mind the most successful of all the works, perhaps because it is the
most modest and the most embedded in the great tradition of grandiose
state architecture. Indeed, it sits on <I>le grand axe </I>connecting
the Cour Carr&eacute;e to the Arc de Triomphe by way of the Petit Arc
with its copy of the purloined Quadrige: the <I>esprit de g&eacute;om&eacute;trie
</I>is moved by the counterpoint the pyramid&rsquo;s triangles make
with the squares and rectangles and semicircles of the Grand Louvre
and the arches, and the <I>esprit de finesse</I> by the ingenious way
in which Pei has inserted the twentieth century into the continuous
conversation of previous centuries that the architecture of the
Louvre embodies.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm; margin-bottom: 0.64cm; line-height: 0.49cm">
What one thinks, ultimately, about the Op&eacute;ra de la Bastille
will depend on how well it serves not architecture but music. From
the outside, however, the building rather too successfully evokes its
namesake: though set in a working-class <I>quartier</I>, presumably
symbolizing the hoped-for democratization of culture that was the
Mitterrand regime&rsquo;s professed aim, the great white fortress
with its steep escarpments seems defensive and rather forlorn&mdash;but
then the old Opera, the Palais Garnier, is only too at home in its
nineteenth-century bourgeois nexus of idleness (the Caf&eacute; de la
Paix on one side) and frenetic commodity fetishism (the Galeries
Lafayette on the other). Even Mitterrand dislikes the new Finance
Ministry. And as for the Tr&egrave;s Grande Biblioth&egrave;que, only
time will tell: if the building can be made to function without
consuming the entire budget of the Ministry of Culture, it may yet
redeem its alleged architectural blunders.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm; margin-bottom: 0.64cm; line-height: 0.49cm">
I think I first fell in love with Paris <I>because</I> of its very
grandiloquence. Now, however, as a true <I>paysan de Paris</I>, I
search instinctively for those corners of intimacy where one can feel
not, as Tocqueville said, like a particle of dust before the colossus
of the state but a whole human being. Yet I know that these private
refuges from <I>la grandeur</I> would not have quite so magical a
glow were it not for the public text, which they serve as a kind of
illumination: we may forget, for we can no longer even read, the
scripture of <I>Les Tr&egrave;s Riches Heures</I>, yet without it the
sublime interstitial art would not exist. The Mitterrand addendum to
the public text is true enough to its essential spirit: it is not a
spirit one can feel entirely comfortable with, but without it,
surely, <I>la France ne serait plus la France.</I></P>
