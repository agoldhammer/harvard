<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Jean
Renoir's masterpiece, <I>The Rules of the Game</I> (1939), changed
film forever. For some this cinematic epitome of the human comedy is
an addicting pleasure: Truffaut saw the film fifteen times. But it
failed to please its first audiences in the somber weeks preceding
the outbreak of hostilities in World War II. No doubt a movie so
exuberant was out of tune with its time. But even the sympathetic
Ren&eacute; Clair, who watched the opening with Renoir, was
bewildered: &quot;What exactly were you trying to do?&quot; he asked.
Renoir, according to his biographer C&eacute;lia Bertin, answered, &quot;I
don't care.&quot; And indeed the film is easier to like than to
understand.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The
difficulty is not with the plot, which is conventional enough. The
handsome young aviator Andr&eacute; Jurieux flies solo across the
Atlantic to impress a woman with whom he is infatuated, Christine,
marquise de La Chesnaye. He is disappointed when she fails to meet
his plane at Le Bourget. His friend Octave contrives to have him
invited to the country ch&acirc;teau of Christine's husband, Robert,
marquis de La Chesnaye. Robert allows himself to be persuaded by
Octave's suggestion that he might well rid himself of his troublesome
mistress, Genevi&egrave;ve de Marras, by interesting her in Andr&eacute;,
at the same time putting an end to whatever flirtation might be going
on between Andr&eacute; and Christine. But Christine accidentally
discovers Robert's infidelity, and her reaction sets in motion a
chain of events that leads to Andr&eacute;'s murder by Schumacher,
the marquis's gamekeeper, in a case of double mistaken identity.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote1anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A></SUP></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Renoir's
masterpiece thus hinges on a moment of recognition: the marquise's
discovery, as she peers through a lens, of her husband's infidelity.
It is a moment of recognition that effects a reversal in the
behavior, though not in the fortunes, of the heroine. Recognition
(<I>anagnorisis</I>) leading to reversal (<I>peripeteia</I>): the
drama would fit Aristotle's definition of tragedy were it not for the
fact that the marquis will not permit, and has the power to prevent,
his wife's fall into disgrace. The tragedy hangs fire. Despite the
murder things will go on as they have always done. The rich and
powerful can be counted on to put a proper face on deeds most foul.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Such
a d&eacute;nouement invites cynical comment, and Renoir does not fail
to provide it. When the marquis calls Jurieux's murder an accident,
Saint-Aubin is derisive: &quot;A new definition of the word
<I>accident</I>.&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote2anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A></SUP>
But he is immediately pulled up short by the hoary Nestorian general,
who, on each previous occasion when Saint-Aubin has given the cynical
interpretation of things, has rebuked him in similar terms. What the
marquis has just displayed, the general says, is &quot;class,&quot;
and &quot;that's getting rare, Saint-Aubin, that's getting rare.&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote3anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote3sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A></SUP></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 0.85cm">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The
comment is of course double-edged. For those disposed to accept
Saint-Aubin's cynicism, it confirms that &quot;class&quot; (the
adjective or substantive of value) inheres in &quot;the ruling class&quot;
as silver, the metonymy, inheres in silverware. &quot;Class&quot;
becomes a synonym for the <I>haute couture</I> that dresses up naked
power. But the general's previous remarks incline us to take him not
as a doddering dupe but as a wise fool (the wise fool, one might say,
because the kind of wisdom, or folly, he represents always plays the
same role, which is to insist that things are on occasion just what
they appear to be, that at times a cigar is just a cigar). The cynic
wants to short-cut the difficult business of interpretation by
asserting that everything is the opposite of what it seems. In some
circumstances this can give the cynic the appearance of perspicacity,
but more often it signifies that he is just as deluded as the person
who says, always and everywhere, that things are simply as they
appear (an enforcement of simplicity that is simply foolish, not at
all wise). Saint-Aubin's cynicism feigns a privileged access to the
truth: he thinks he knows how Jurieux died, on orders of the marquis,
who has presumably chosen the shortest way to rid himself of a rival.
Earlier in the film, in another aside to the general, Saint-Aubin
reacted to Christine's assertion that her relations with Jurieux had
unfolded &quot;under the sign of friendship, which is so rare.&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote4anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote4sym"><SUP>4</SUP></A></SUP>
On this Saint-Aubin's comment was, &quot;It's all in the family&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote5anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote5sym"><SUP>5</SUP></A></SUP>&mdash;his
way of insisting on his certainty that what exists between Christine
and Jurieux is not &quot;amiti&eacute;&quot; but love. But his clear
picture of the situation was as wrong then as it is now (though it
serves, with economical artistry, to paint Saint-Aubin himself as a
blackguard for whom such a murder is thinkable). He is misled by his
mechanical formula for converting appearances into realities. The
truth, contrary to what Saint-Aubin believes, cannot be captured in a
still image; it requires a moving picture.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">We
thus come back to the moment of reversal. The instrument that makes
possible the marquise's recognition of infidelity is a small
telescope or binocular, a lens. But what Christine sees and, because
she sees it with her own eyes, mistakes for the truth, is not the
truth but only a moment, as Hegel might say, in truth's unfolding:
the affair between Robert and Genevi&egrave;ve de Marras has a long
history, and what the lens shows, though a revelation to the woman
who holds it, is the end of the affair, which Christine mistakenly
takes to be proof of its existence. (The owl of Minerva flies at
night, so to speak.) Christine &quot;reifies&quot; her husband's
feelings, turns them into a thing rather than a flux, and so
misconstrues them. She then sets about verifying, with the rigor of a
positivist, what she now posits the truth to be: in her rival's
bedroom she puts leading questions, elicits the expected answers, and
puts down their coincidence with the predictions of her own theory as
confirmation of that theory's validity. By thus treating human nature
as if it were physical nature, she transgresses one of the boundaries
that ought properly to be drawn around certain methods of inquiry,
and it is this transgression that precipitates the tragedy.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 0.85cm">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">One
might also put the matter in another way. What the marquise sees
through the lens is confirmation of a theory she already holds, a
theory she cannot help holding. For she is an adult woman in a
society where adultery, apparently, is so much the norm that her
having spent a few hours with Jurieux &quot;under the sign of
friendship&quot; can be taken by everyone, including Jurieux himself,
as evidence if not of her complicity at least of her readiness to be
complicit in an extramarital affair. Hence she must believe if not in
her husband's adultery at least in its possibility. Yet she has
repressed this theoretical belief, so that when La Chesnaye questions
her she can respond that she &quot;trusts him completely.&quot; The
visible evidence of deceit triggers the return of this repressed
theory, and the marquise reacts to this return as to a trauma: the
integrity of her conception of herself as a woman is violated, and
she is suddenly transformed, like a wounded beast, into a quite
different woman, a faithless wife who, having withheld herself in
stiff innocence inadvertently magnified by Nora Gregor's stiff
acting, can plunge headlong into affairs, or at least promises of
affairs, with three men: Saint-Aubin, Jurieux, Octave.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 0.85cm">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">This
return of the repressed can be interpreted in psychodynamic as well
as epistemological terms. What Christine sees, or thinks she sees, is
a man making love to a woman. This is a scene she is not supposed to
witness. In fact, it is the primal scene, which none of us is
supposed to witness. She sees, enacted, what she already knows men of
this class and in this society do to women who are not their wives,
and she remembers having seen, or imagined seeing, enacted what she,
as a child, already knew all men do to women who are their wives.
Perhaps she took that discovery, which was not really a discovery, to
be a trauma too. (That what she sees is more memory than reality is
underscored by the fact that Octave&mdash;played by Renoir, the
director behind the lens&mdash;stands behind her as she peers at
Robert and Genevi&egrave;ve in the distance. He cannot see what she
sees, not because he lacks the magnifying technology of the lens, but
because she is seeing more with her inner than with her outer eye.)
Perhaps she denied her complicity in the injury, her guilty desire to
take her mother's place, to be loved by her husband as he loves his
mistress. If so, it might explain (along with Nora Gregor's imperfect
mastery of French) the curious contrasts in her vocal mannerisms and
body language. With the marquis her movements are as stiff as her
speech is stilted: she is an ornament of the household, like one of
his mechanical dolls. Yet with the maid Lisette she inhabits her body
differently. In her neglig&eacute;e she displays nonchalance. Her
speech, less formal, is also more playful. And she exhibits a
prurient curiosity about Lisette's lovers. On sexual matters she is
not the innocent the plot more than the marquis requires. One goad to
her curiosity with Lisette, moreover, is that among the maid's lovers
is Octave, Christine's childhood companion, her father's proteg&eacute;,
the man with whom the girl she once was had perhaps fantasized about
enacting what she had seen, or imagined she had seen, her father
enact with her mother.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 0.85cm">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Octave's
role is a curious one. It is of course one of the two elements (along
with the mistaken identity leading to a death) that connects Renoir's
film with one of its two chief precursors in the French comedic
tradition, Alfred de Musset's <I>Les Caprices de Marianne</I> (the
other being Beaumarchais's <I>Le Mariage de Figaro</I>, to which I
shall return). Musset's Octave, though a drunkard and ne'er-do-well,
is blessed with a silver tongue: he is a poet&mdash;and as the
marquis says of Renoir's Octave, a dangerous poet. (For the marquis,
&quot;dangerous&quot; is a qualification of poet; but for Renoir, who
puts these words in his mouth as a description of himself&mdash;for
Renoir, who plays Octave, who is Octave&mdash;they mean, I think, you
are a poet and therefore dangerous. Are not all poets dangerous?
Plato says so, and for just the reason that poets are shown to be
dangerous in both <I>Les Caprices</I> and <I>La R&egrave;gle</I>:
they subvert order. That is why Renoir likes to play off French
theatrical and Viennese musical classicism, against the metaphor of
the theater in general as a confining cadre or order, which cinema
explodes.) Because he is a poet Octave is enlisted by Coelio to serve
as an intermediary between him and Marianne, the wife of Judge
Claudio. His task is to persuade Marianne that Coelio is indeed &quot;in
love&quot; with her, where the attributes of love have been defined
by a long tradition: love, for the male, is a state of intoxication,
of rapture, of loss of will, of abjection. Abjection particularly:
love is a reversal of what everyone knows to be the actual state of
affairs, that men dominate and women serve. Romantic love is love
because it temporarily suspends this reality. The man declares
himself to be abject, the lady subjects him to ordeals, and if he
proves his mettle she then yields. But when she yields her power
dissipates. The man has added her to his conquests. By the time
Musset writes, this tradition is moribund. If Coelio, quixotic
prisoner of convention that he is, still behaves as though it bound
him, neither Octave nor Marianne can believe in a genre that, since
the invention of courtly love in the twelfth century, had rung all
its changes. And one of the last of those changes was precisely the
introduction of the intermediary&mdash;Octave's role&mdash;whose
gifted tongue is capable of overcoming the wised-up woman's
reluctance to believe in the lover's mere outward signs of abjection.
The intermediary paints a portrait of inward abjection more
persuasive than a kneeling or sighing knight. Language externalizes
the inner exaltation or bewilderment or derangement into which love
has plunged the lover. In the theatrical tradition that Musset
concludes and parodies, language signifies desire.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 0.85cm">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Even
more, language becomes desire. That was the most recent convention,
and would still be the convention when Rostand wrote <I>Cyrano</I>.
The intermediary, who may begin by representing the love of another,
becomes infected by that love; or the power of words is so great that
speaking words of love in another man's place creates the state of
intoxication that love is, because in the words the desire becomes
present&mdash;the word is made flesh, as it were. When Octave
fulfills his mission on behalf of Coelio, Marianne stops him: &quot;Get
up, Octave! Really, if someone were to come in and hear you, wouldn't
they think you were pleading on your own behalf?&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote6anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote6sym"><SUP>6</SUP></A></SUP>
Musset's Marianne (having inherited both the intelligence and the
<I>marivaudage</I> of Marivaux's Marianne) knows the convention
inside out: she knows that Octave's words are a &quot;plea,&quot;
that is, a rhetorical utterance intended to bring about a desired
result, not a representation of the truth, and she knows, too&mdash;despite
the slip of the tongue (Octave says &quot;<I>my</I> heart is full&quot;)
that might elsewhere signify that the agent has become the actor&mdash;what
Octave's game is. She is willing to have him for a lover precisely
because he is as little a dupe of the game as she is.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Renoir's
Octave is not like Musset's, except in one respect: he aspires high
and sleeps low. He is the one character in the film who crosses,
physically, the boundary between the servants' world and the
masters'. (The marquis and marquise cross the boundary too, but only
in conversation, he with the poacher Marceau, she with the maid
Lisette&mdash;the film's second adulterous couple). Musset's Octave
explains his sexual tastes in a remarkable exchange with Marianne.
She says she thought that &quot;with wine it's the same as with
women.&quot; There are the noble vintages and the <I>vin du peuple</I>,
and a man of taste like Octave can be counted on to know the
difference. Since he drinks fine wine, he ought to lust after fine
women (for example, herself). He responds: &quot;How long do you
think you need to court the bottle you see there to win its favors?&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote7anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote7sym"><SUP>7</SUP></A></SUP>
Courting&mdash;the elaborate linguistic ritual of representing
desire, of converting desire into language&mdash;has become a
transparent game whose conventions they both know well enough to
mock, hence a bore. Why bother? Fine wine offers no resistance, nor
does the <I>femme du peuple</I>.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">In
1939 language is no longer necessary to the romantic illusion.
Technology has created a new, artificial immediacy. The role of the
lens in the central scene of recognition, the primal scene, is one
instance. But Renoir alerts us to the importance of technology as
mediator from the film's first frames: the opening shot is of a radio
studio, and the camera then follows cables out to the airfield where
Jurieux has just landed. When the reporter asks him to describe his
heroic feat, he demurs: &quot;It wasn't me, it was the equipment.&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote8anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote8sym"><SUP>8</SUP></A></SUP>
The machine was the hero, the man merely the pilot. An engineer then
describes the plane (a Caudron, the type of plane Renoir flew in the
war). The next scenes unfold in sequence, and the radio that figures
in each of them establishes a continuity of consciousness as well as
time. We enter the marquise's bedroom, in fact, through the back of
the radio: the camera pans up from its initial focus on the vacuum
tubes and condensers to reveal Christine's unease. Jurieux declares
his love for her, speaking as a lover immediately into her ear, but
by the miracle of radio he can do this without being present. A space
is thus created for a complex reaction to unfold, a reaction that
cannot be suspected, as any response in Jurieux's presence could and
would have been suspected, of bad faith, because Christine reacts for
herself, not for the other. Jurieux proclaims his love, its
authenticity guaranteed not by high-flown poetry but by the immediacy
of modern communication; Christine, meanwhile, does her toilette. She
asks her maid about her lovers, about Octave. She asks what these
lovers do, not because she is innocent of sex but because Lisette
knows what Christine can never know but is intensely curious about:
how a <I>femme du peuple</I>, not bound by the rules of the game,
makes love. Lisette tells her that men are insatiable.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The
marquis, in his room, can also hear. The publicity of Jurieux's
profession of love tells us at once that in this modern game of love
the husband will not be the dupe; whatever happens will happen under
his eyes. Obligingly, he even provides Christine with an acceptable
explanation for the private violation of propriety on her part that
led to this public violation of Jurieux's: what Christine and Andr&eacute;
share is an <I>amiti&eacute; amoureuse</I>, a sort of synthesis of
the thesis <I>amour</I> and its antithesis <I>amiti&eacute;</I>. Also
tuned to the same wavelength is Robert's mistress Genevi&egrave;ve,
and neither she nor the card players in her apartment are in any
doubt about the meaning of Jurieux's words: they are the chorus, the
voice of convention, which assumes adultery as a fact, because this
is what society assumes.</FONT></FONT></P>

said of capitalist society that it was one in which relations between
human beings are replaced by relations between things. In Renoir's
film, which concerns the elite of an advanced capitalist society,
relations between human beings are mediated by things&mdash;man-made
things. Indeed, it is this substitution of technical for human
mediation that defines this society as advanced. This transformation
of society has resulted in a transformation of romantic love, a
transformation that Musset glimpsed. But since the full realization
of that transformation entailed the replacement of an outworn
rhetoric by novel devices, Musset could not fully register the
change, which in any case had not yet fully worked itself through.
The camera enables Renoir to represent a change that could not easily
be caught in language since it was, in essence, an absence of
language. Thus the lens&mdash;the lens of the glass the marquise uses
in the hunt&mdash;is the film's central image, as well as the
technical condition of its possibility.</FONT></FONT></P>

was the perfection, moreover, of new wide-aperture lenses and fast
film that permitted Renoir to move beyond the close-up to the
deep-focus scenes that were the film's primary stylistic innovation
and its chief attraction to the younger filmmakers of the New Wave.
But Renoir was not a man to avail himself of a device of style simply
as a flourish. The greatness of <I>La R&egrave;gle du jeu</I>&mdash;its
claim on the history of culture and not just the history of film&mdash;lies
in its melding of two distinct comedic traditions, the traditions of
Figaro and Marianne, and it was deep-focus that made this melding
possible.</FONT></FONT></P>

gives us the ch&acirc;teau as the world. It is a world of pairings
and of pairings within pairings. The servant's world is the image of
the master's world as man is the image of God. But the question is
whether one is the original and the other the copy, or whether each
is the image of the other, the reflection of a reflection (the
original being that eighteenth-century utopia in which all men are
created equal). At stake is the hierarchy of the ancien r&eacute;gime,
which depends on the master's identification with, or usurpation of,
the creator's position. Beaumarchais is an illusionist. He gives
Figaro the gift of the circus clown who can create the illusion of a
mirror by duplicating the movements of the Other in inverse
perfection. Moving within a world&mdash;the ch&acirc;teau&mdash;clearly
of the master's creation, Figaro creates the illusion that the
master's moiety is neither more nor less than a reflection of the
servant's moiety. Renoir uses the device of pairing but insists on a
vestigial asymmetry whose locus is sex. For the marquis, who has
other pleasures, sex is an amusement; for Schumacher, who has none,
it is deadly serious. Only the servants who have other
pleasures&mdash;Marceau, who has the gift of humor, and Lisette, who
has her erotic attachment to the marquise&mdash;can enjoy, in a
relative sense, the freedom of the masters.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">What
is the game in <I>Rules of the Game</I>? The superficial answer is
that it is the game of marital infidelity: society diverts erotic
energies that might otherwise be destructive by permitting certain
men to appropriate certain women for the purpose of temporary
gratification. The rules are: that serious (i.e., legal or financial)
claims must be avoided; that appearances must be maintained; that
certain proprieties must be respected (&quot;the young,&quot; Lisette
reminds Octave, &quot;should go with the young, the old with the
old&quot;). Andr&eacute; and Christine are presented as neophytes in
this game. Octave must explain the rules to both. He tells Andr&eacute;
that Christine is not &quot;like a good glass of wine&quot; (the
simile directly recalls Musset's). And he tells Christine that her
friendly overtures to Andr&eacute; can be, and have been, taken
(mistaken?) for a gamer's moves. We are asked to believe that
Christine, as a foreigner, simply doesn't know the rules and that
this ignorance explains her violations. When Genevi&egrave;ve
threatens to expose Robert's infidelity, she warns him that he will
lose Christine, who won't understand that he was simply playing a
harmless game: &quot;A Parisian woman would understand. Her, no.&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote9anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote9sym"><SUP>9</SUP></A></SUP>
After Octave explains the rules, Christine concedes that she has
erred: &quot;Then all the wrongs are mine&quot; (<I>alors, j'ai tous
les torts</I>), she tells him in her fractured French. &quot;Not all&quot;
Octave replies, &quot;some,&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote10anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote10sym"><SUP>10</SUP></A></SUP>
as if he knows or suspects that her ignorance is partly feigned, that
it is perhaps the master-stroke of a consummately skilled player.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Why
do I suspect Christine of dissimulation? Because she is the only
character in the film (except perhaps her niece Jackie, whose motives
are undeveloped) who actively seeks a gratification more complex than
this first-level game can conceivably provide. Octave has abandoned
his ambitions; Robert disclaims the talent to have any (&quot;for
that you have to be talented,&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote11anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote11sym"><SUP>11</SUP></A></SUP>
he tells Marceau); Andr&eacute; is a &quot;modern hero&quot; who &quot;the
minute he touches ground is like a child.&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote12anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote12sym"><SUP>12</SUP></A></SUP>
Christine is the only character with adult desires. What does she
want?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 0.85cm">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">What
do women want? Everything. Christine wants a lover who is also a
friend. (Lisette, with the wisdom of <I>le peuple</I>, declares this
to be impossible: &quot;Friendship with a man! There's no such
thing.&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote13anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote13sym"><SUP>13</SUP></A></SUP>
Although the statement is given as a general truth, we are entitled
to take it simply as an absence of desire that defines Lisette.)
Christine wants children. (When Lisette points out that &quot;children
take a lot of time,&quot; Christine answers, &quot;That's the nice
thing. You don't think about anything else.&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote14anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote14sym"><SUP>14</SUP></A></SUP>)
 Having children is &quot;nice&quot; because it distracts. Of what
other things does Christine no longer wish to think? Of the diversion
of romance, perhaps; of unheroic heroes like Jurieux; of the silly
games that society plays; of one's husband's friendly, or fatherly,
sexual indifference; of one's fatherly friend's repressed sexual
longing; of the senselessness of a life whose chief amusement, the
pointless slaughter of the hunt, one does not even find amusing; of a
world in which &quot;nothing is natural any more&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote15anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote15sym"><SUP>15</SUP></A></SUP>
and &quot;everyone lies: druggists' ads, the government, the movies,
the newspapers;&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote16anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote16sym"><SUP>16</SUP></A></SUP>
of the imminence of war (the time is November 1938). Christine wants
food for the spirit (one of the card players in Genevi&egrave;ve's
apartment alludes to the loss she must have suffered when
transplanted from the pinnacle of Viennese cultural life to a milieu
philistine by comparison, where the music is provided by automata).</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">So
Christine is playing a different game from everyone else's. Hers is
therefore a game of one player. In such a game any rules are
self-imposed, and any cheating, if punished at all, must be
self-punished. A one-player game is therefore a test of character, or
perhaps more precisely, character is a game of one player. And the
reason why Christine feels so violated by her verification of
Robert's infidelity is that, his behavior having revealed that &quot;for
the past three years my life has been based on a lie,&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote17anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote17sym"><SUP>17</SUP></A></SUP>
her strategy has been all wrong. She sees how far from her goal she
is. Her reaction is one of desperation. And in desperation she
regresses, or, to put it another way, she steps out of character, she
changes the rules of the game, of her game. She literally becomes a
child again: the camera shows us this in the remarkable scene in the
gun room when she says to Jurieux for the first time, &quot;I love
you, Andr&eacute;&quot;, and he says, &quot;I'd lost faith.&quot;.
Having put aside her Chanel gowns for the evening's entertainment,
she is wearing a Tyrolean dress that makes her look like a girl, and,
in a circumstance where we might expect a close-up the camera shoots
her from above and from an awkward medium distance, foreshortening
the image so that, set against a fireplace in the background to her
left, she looks half as tall as she had appeared a moment before
saying &quot;I love you.&quot; The adult woman Christine could never
have uttered these words to Jurieux, who is more boy than man. But he
(shot in closeup against a door, which emphasizes his adult size)
fails to perceive the change and claims her as a man: the love in
which he had lost faith was a love that never existed, the mundane
love, the society love, the love of the infidelity game. This new
declaration of love is from a little girl, not a woman: earlier
Octave had tried to correct her behavior by saying &quot;you're not
twelve years old any more,&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote18anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote18sym"><SUP>18</SUP></A></SUP>
but now she is twelve again. She has reentered the world of
childhood. Earlier her childish behavior (with Octave on the bed, for
example) had been play-acting; now she tells Octave &quot;I've had
enough of this theater,&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote19anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote19sym"><SUP>19</SUP></A></SUP>
of the theater, that is, of adulthood, which she finds so difficult
(&quot;It's hard,&quot; she has told Robert, &quot;to live a lie.&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote20anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote20sym"><SUP>20</SUP></A></SUP>)
His response, for all that it contains of the truth,
characteristically fails to register her pain: &quot;A lie? A lie?
You're exaggerating, my dear friend.&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote21anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote21sym"><SUP>21</SUP></A></SUP>).
Freed of the burden of the theater, of the actress's burden of
seeming convincingly to belong to a world not of her making,
Christine returns in earnest to &quot;the mood of childhood, when we
were ignorant of the comic, when we were incapable of jokes and when
we had no need of humor to make us feel happy in our life&quot;
(Freud, <I>Wit and Its Relation to the Unconscious</I>, quoted by
Stanley Cavell in <I>Pursuits of Happiness</I>, whose insights into
the comedy of [re]marriage have encouraged me here).</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Throughout
the film free play is made with the notion of childhood. (The
ambiguity of the French <I>jeu</I> is important here: game is also
play, and play is also play-acting.) &quot;For me,&quot; Octave tells
Christine, &quot;you're still the child from Salzburg.&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote22anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote22sym"><SUP>22</SUP></A></SUP>
You're supposed to be a hero but in fact &quot;you're nothing but a
little kid,&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote23anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote23sym"><SUP>23</SUP></A></SUP>
Octave tells Andr&eacute;. Robert fills his life with mechanical
toys. Marceau and Lisette chase each other around the kitchen.
&quot;Robert is truly a child,&quot; Christine tells Genevi&egrave;ve,
&quot;incapable of hiding anything.&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote24anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote24sym"><SUP>24</SUP></A></SUP>
Incapable of hiding anything: if that is the criterion of the &quot;true
child,&quot; then obviously the society depicted here is the
antithesis of childhood, for it is a society built on masks from top
to bottom. (The best example of the donning of one is the serving
maid who, about to enter the main hall with a tray of dishes,
composes a face that has been laughing openly about the presumed
illicit relation between Jurieux and Christine; the camera obliquely
catches the moment when the mask falls over the true visage as class
prepares to meet class.)</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Childhood
is a paradise, but like what the French Bible calls the Paradis
Terrestre and ours calls the Garden of Eden, it is a paradise we
cannot reenter. Film, it has been said, participates in this
essentially human longing for a foreclosed past. Jay Cantor, for
example, pays tribute to Stanely Cavell, who &quot;places Film in the
volume marked Memory; for films, like memories, give us a world that
is ours, yet that we are barred from entering.&quot; For one
miraculous moment, though, in the resurrection of Christine's father,
the great Viennese conductor Stiller, Andr&eacute; and Christine do
reenter the past. It is an explicitly dionysiac scene: set in the
moonlight; Christine with vine leaves and flowers in her hair, which
streams in wild dishevelment; Octave purified by a ritual of
initiation in which, earlier, he had dressed as a bear (like the
little girls of Brauron in the Greek festival known as the
Brauronia); and both having drunk too much. The natural order of
things has been overturned; but it can last only a moment. And even
if it were otherwise, a child cannot conduct an orchestra; a child
cannot bear children. Perhaps most important, a girl cannot marry her
father. (&quot;The problem,&quot; Octave tells Christine, &quot;is
that when you think about your father, you're not fair to other
men.&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote25anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote25sym"><SUP>25</SUP></A></SUP>
But earlier he has told Andr&eacute;, in response to the aviator's
reminder that &quot;you are not her father,&quot; that with her
father dead he has assumed the conductor's place, if not as a
conductor of a orchestras then at least as a conductor of the
daughter's life&mdash;which is indeed Octave's sin, the sin that
makes him, for the space of this movie, not the &quot;failure&quot;
and &quot;parasite&quot; he accuses himself of being and outside the
frame no doubt is but &quot;a dangerous poet.&quot;) This Paradise is
paradisaical, in part, because it is suffused with the future's
unfulfilled but not yet thwarted wishes. This past, the past that
matters to us, is a creation of the present; it has no independent
existence.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 0.85cm">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Leading
up to this dionysiac moment is the breakdown of the order of which
the ch&acirc;teau is the embodiment. Run away with me, Genevi&egrave;ve
urges Robert, and when he protests that he cannot leave &quot;the
property,&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote26anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote26sym"><SUP>26</SUP></A></SUP>
she asks why it matters, &quot;<I>ce n'est qu'une maison.</I>&quot;
<I>Maison</I>&mdash;the word (unaccountably misrepresented in the
subtitles as &quot;<I>ch&acirc;teau</I>&quot;) is meant to diminish,
to disparage all that a <I>ch&acirc;teau</I> symbolizes not only as
architecture but as the assertion of an order in the world. In reply
Robert can manage only a gasp of exasperation. That the importance of
the ch&acirc;teau needs explanation is already a sign that it has
lost its importance. The camera has made this breakdown palpable by
showing us the space in which it occurs. Rooms are shot in deep
focus. The lens is not stationary, but its movements are stately and
underscore the structure of the maison by sweeping, as the eye of the
awed visitor might, from limit to limit of its ample rooms. Thus
invested with the imposing decorousness of the surroundings, the
camera takes on the &quot;gentleman's gentleman&quot; eye of the
butler Corneille. (Is it an accident that the name instantly makes
the camera the representative as well of the classical theatrical
tradition? And Corneille, incidentally, was the author of <I>M&eacute;lite</I>,
the comedy from which Musset drew <I>Les Caprices</I>.) The camera
casts its disapproving eye on the frenzy of the action, as the game
warden Schumacher attempts to avenge Marceau's poaching on his wife,
as Christine's fugue unfolds, as the great mechanical organ slips
from raunchy raucousness into a cacophony of grinds and thumps, as
death does its macabre dance (the skeletons carry umbrella frames,
nonexistent protection against the heavens' empty threat). Doors,
which in previous long shots down castle corridors have emphasized
the strict cloisonnement, the rigorously respected privacy that
allows society's game to continue, are now thrown open, revealing
secret lusts, acts of violence, uncontrolled emotions. (The marquis,
at several points, signals his dissatisfaction with the existing
order of things by stating his aversion to fences, barriers, and
walls. He wants no fences, he tells Schumacher, but neither does he
want rabbits&mdash;an insistence on order without discipline that
Schumacher, the Teuton, cannot comprehend.)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 0.85cm">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Indeed,
the situation has been created by the marquis's disdain of walls, by
his belief in freedom. When Octave suggests that he invite Jurieux to
La Colini&egrave;re, Robert recognizes that, in a world whose
principle is not honor but freedom, his wife's fidelity is
meaningless if coerced. Octave has just uttered his devastating
pronouncement&mdash;the verdict of a man who believes himself dead&mdash;on
the modern world: &quot;What is truly dreadful is that everyone has
his reasons.&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote27anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote27sym"><SUP>27</SUP></A></SUP>
(In the hierarchical world of honor, only one reason counts: God's,
which those who rule the world take also to be theirs.) Humane,
speaking for the spirit of the Lumi&egrave;res, Robert answers
Octave: &quot;Yes, and I think everyone should be free to express
them fully. I don't believe in walls.&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote28anc" HREF="REGLE.html#sdendnote28sym"><SUP>28</SUP></A></SUP>
Man is free, Kant would say, only if he is obedient, not to the will
of the sovereign, but to the concept of law. Later, when everything
has collapsed, of course, Robert in sorrow reverts to a more
primitive view. The Arabs, he tells Marceau, had it right when they
created harems, where a man could have his favorite without making
the others miserable. But surely he remembers Montesquieu and <I>Les
Lettres Persanes</I>: Uzbek, who believes he is an enlightened
despot, is instructed by Roxane's treachery that freedom must be
universal or illusory; if freedom exists, then no sovereign is free,
or no man can be sovereign. These two scenes, which frame the
theatrical unity of the action at La Colini&egrave;re, situate that
action within the larger tragedy, the European tragedy whose
unfolding coincided with the conception and making of <I>La R&egrave;gle
du Jeu</I>. If Christine's derangement is the subject of the drama
within, Europe's derangement is the subject of the drama without. But
how are outside and inside related?</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The
world of the Enlightenment, the handiwork of the hidden clockmaker
God who set the machinery in motion and then retired to his country
seat&mdash;a world in which the automata that are the marquis's
fetish were not a bizarre curiosity but a miracle, an assertion of
man's increasing ability by his own efforts to create the
animal-machine, to substitute himself for the Creator&mdash;that
world has broken down. It is no longer a matter, as in Beaumarchais,
of adjusting the mechanism by shifting its driving force from the
count to Figaro. The machine is out of control. (Mechanical breakdown
is a repeated motif in the film: the automobile crash, the broken
birds, Robert's lighter that will not light in his adieu to
Genevi&egrave;ve, the winding down of the mechanical organ). In four
scenes that detach themselves from the body of the film by visual
distinctiveness, we leave behind the ch&acirc;teau-as-world metaphor.
There is the opening scene in which an airplane descends out of
darkness onto a chaotic mob. There is the accident scene, in which
Octave and Andr&eacute; are shot (initially) from the ditch, from the
point of view of the wrecked machine, against an empty sky. There is
the scene of the hunt. And there is the final sequence leading up to
Jurieux's death, which includes an idyll in a greenhouse&mdash;Paradis
Terrestre&mdash;observed from the outside by Marceau and Schumacher,
both excluded, both banished, both postlapsarian, formerly enemies,
now united in violent jealousy of the happiness of the other. In each
case the camera associates us, the spectators, with a source of
upheaval, disorder, tumult. In the crowd scene we are part of the
crowd. Our view moves with it; we cannot stay focused for long on one
point; we catch a fleeting glimpse of the plane as it lands; we must
fight through the crush to join the hero. In the crash scene our
sight is identified with the machine; insofar as we have allowed
ourselves to become machines the sky above is empty for us; a
washed-out expanse. The quarreling men are characters out of Beckett
<I>avant la lettre</I>, filling up the time while waiting for Godot.
In the hunt the point of view shifts several times. We see the
beaters and the shooters from the animals' vantage, as part of
nature; but we also see the animals die; we are the shooters,
disrupting nature for our sport. And in the final sequence we look in
on Paradise from the outside along with the two killers. Now read the
scenes in sequence: mass man, mechanization, exaltation of violence,
leading to murder, to the extinction of a flawed but plausible
Earthly Paradise. The film is located precisely in time: November
1938, a few months after Munich. It appeared in July 1939. In a month
or two the world would be at war. The final cut of Rules would be
blown up by Allied bombs in 1942.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Renoir,
who conceived the film in January of 1939, once described it&mdash;we
do not know with what jest in his voice&mdash;as his &quot;response
to the Munich accords.&quot; If we think of the response to a
political event as, typically, a lugubrious manifesto&mdash;there
were many in those months after Munich&mdash;the statement is
farfetched. But if we think of Munich&mdash;and many in 1939 did
think of it&mdash;as the announcement of an impending apocalypse, why
should we be surprised that an artist as inventive as Renoir
responded by producing a film as boldly imaginative in its way as the
Book of Revelation? Or, if such a model is thought too august for a
mere film, we need look back, perhaps, no farther than Victor Hugo.
Renoir specifically invokes Hugo in the film: when Marceau, the
poacher, is polishing boots in the ch&acirc;teau kitchen, he cites
first a line from Corneille (whose name, as we have seen, functions
in the film as a metonymy for the crumbling classical order) and then
a line from Hugo: &quot;<I>L'oeil &eacute;tait dans la tombe et
regardait Cain.</I>&quot; Hugo invoking the Bible in <I>La Conscience</I>
thus anticipates the murder of the Frenchman Jurieux by the German
Schumacher with the complicity of the Frenchman Marceau: Cain and
Abel&mdash;brother kills brother, or at least <I>fr&egrave;re ennemi</I>
kills <I>fr&egrave;re ennemi</I>. But the line also puts the
spectator in mind of another poem by that dangerous poet, Hugo, in
which he writes of that dangerous angel, the Antichrist (recall that
early in the film Octave calls Christine a &quot;dangerous angel&quot;
and Robert calls Octave a &quot;dangerous poet&quot;):</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The
description might be of Jurieux in the film's opening sequence. On
his lonely lover's mission he descends from the heavens in darkness,
<I>hideux amant de la nuit solitaire</I>, riding on wings, not of
iron, perhaps, but of aluminum. He is frightened of his own mystery:
the myth of the modern hero. But later, when Christine confesses her
love, we see him wearing his angelic mask, his features suffused with
heaven-borrowed charms, and then he steps in front of the gun
cabinet: <I>v&ecirc;tu de radieuses armes</I>, his body is luminous
and his eyes smile, bathed in sweet tears. And we hear, later, that
&quot;<I>on verra .. les morts tressaillir au bruit de sa
parole,/Comme s'ils allaient s'&eacute;veiller</I>,&quot; just as the
dead do dance on the stage of La Colini&egrave;re. There is no need,
I think, to belabor the comparison: the apocalypse implicit in the
four detached sequences of the film that I have singled out is clear
even without the Hugo parallel. But the Hugo identification has the
merit of pointing up Renoir's self-consciousness as an artist in
film. He might have said, as Hugo did in <I>R&eacute;ponse &agrave;
un acte d'accusation</I>, &quot;<I>Ces grandes questions d'art et de
libert&eacute;,/Voyons-les, j'y consens, par le moindre c&ocirc;t&eacute;,/Et
par le petit bout de la lorgnette</I> [that lens again]. ... <I>Sur
les bataillons d'alexandrins carr&eacute;s,/Je fis souffler un vent
r&eacute;volutionnaire.</I>&quot; Like Hugo's, Renoir's work is
impregnated with the old forms and therefore pregnant with the new.
After <I>The Rules of the Game</I> the movies were never the same.</FONT></FONT></P>

	A word about names: in the videotape version of the film that I have
	seen most recently, the names as given in the credits differ from
	the names that appear in the English subtitles. Thus Jurieux is also
	Jurieu, La Chesnaye is also La Cheysniet, and so on. Here I have
	followed the spellings in C&eacute;lia Bertin, <I>Jean
	Renoir</I>(Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1991).</P>
