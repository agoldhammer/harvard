<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Distaste for the
Enlightenment is the pathognomonic sign of the postmodern. Language,
once the centerpiece of the mouthwatering eighteenth-century feast,
has gone off, we are told, turned rotten. About language, they say,
the old masters were always wrong: because their theories of language
embody a dubious &ldquo;metaphysics of presence,&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
or overtly or covertly adopt one or another misleading
&ldquo;intentionalist&rdquo; or &ldquo;phenomenalist&rdquo; doctrine
of reference,<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
or peremptorily &ldquo;impose a structure on the sign,&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote3anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote3sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
or reduce language to representation, emphasizing the mimetic to the
detriment of the poetic.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote4anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote4sym"><SUP>4</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
The &ldquo;epistemology of conceptual language&rdquo; is alleged to
be &ldquo;self-destructive&rdquo; because it cannot &ldquo;keep
literal reference and figural connotation apart.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote5anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote5sym"><SUP>5</SUP></A></FONT></SUP></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">This last quotation,
from Paul de Man, is emblematic and worth pursuing. De Man would no
doubt have rejected the label &ldquo;postmodernist,&rdquo; but his
interrogation of the Enlightenment conception of language is crucial
for understanding the main point of contention. Indeed, Frederic
Jameson, in a widely read work, remarks that &ldquo;postmodernism may
amount to not much more than theorizing its own condition of
possibility.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote6anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote6sym"><SUP>6</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
Yet the chapter of that work entitled &ldquo;Theory&rdquo; itself
amounts to &ldquo;not much more&rdquo; than a series of footnotes to
de Man&rsquo;s reading of Rousseau. For Jameson, the preeminent
American theorist of the postmodern, de Man is <I>the</I> crucial
transitional thinker, a bridge from the postromantic to the
postmodern. Hence in order to explore what separates the postmodern
from the Enlightenment on the central question of language, we would
do well to recall de Man.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">De Man&rsquo;s argument,
reduced to essentials, is this: that for Rousseau, and for the
Enlightenment in general, man is distinguished from the animals by
his perfectibility; that this perfectibility is thought to rest on a
specifically linguistic capacity, namely, the ability to ascribe
names to general concepts; that the process of naming general
concepts has &ldquo;built into&rdquo; it a &ldquo;substitution of
sameness for difference&rdquo;;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote7anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote7sym"><SUP>7</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
that &ldquo;man&rdquo; himself is a general denomination whose
genesis involves the repression of a primal passion, fear of the
other; and, therefore, that the concept of man, like all other
supposed concrete universals, is incoherent at its root. Upon this
claim about universal nominatives de Man builds a radical skepticism
about the referential capacities of language itself. If &ldquo;man&rdquo;
is in question, if the general concepts that are essential to his
distinctive perfectibility are so many chimeras or repressive
self-delusions, then what, indeed, is Enlightenment? 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">The centerpiece of de
Man&rsquo;s case is his analysis of a brief passage in Rousseau&rsquo;s
<I>Essai sur l&rsquo;origine des langues</I>.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote8anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote8sym"><SUP>8</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
In this passage Rousseau describes the first encounter between a
primitive man living in a state of nature and others of his species.
His initial reaction, Rousseau asserts, is fear, and this fear makes
&ldquo;him see these men as larger and stronger than himself; he will
give them the name <I>giants</I>.&rdquo; But after many similar
experiences, &ldquo;he will discover that the supposed giants are
neither larger nor stronger than himself&rdquo; and &ldquo;he will
then invent another name common to them and him, such as, for
example, <I>man</I>, and will retain the word <I>giant</I> for the
false object that impressed him in his delusional state.&rdquo; De
Man states that this passage is not about denomination as such but
about &ldquo;the linguistic process of conceptualization.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote9anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote9sym"><SUP>9</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
Moreover, &ldquo;conceptualization &hellip; is an intralinguistic
process, the invention of a figural metalanguage that shapes and
articulates the infinitely fragmented and amorphous language of pure
denomination.&rdquo; Up to this point he appears to be interpreting
Rousseau. But now his argument takes one of those characteristic
swerves that are at once the charm and the bane of his peculiar
rhetoric: &ldquo;To the extent that all language is conceptual, it
always already speaks about language and not about things. &hellip;
If all language is about language, then the paradigmatic linguistic
model is that of an entity that confronts itself.&rdquo; Suddenly,
out of nothing, a new concept, <I>language</I>, is born, staring at
itself in a mirror.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">But what sort of concept
is <I>language</I>, which, we are told, &ldquo;always already speaks&rdquo;
about itself? Like <I>man</I>, it is an assertion of sameness in the
place of difference: just as &ldquo;man&rdquo; replaces the
opposition between &ldquo;self&rdquo; and &ldquo;giant,&rdquo; the
general denomination &ldquo;language&rdquo; replaces the opposition
between the &ldquo;language of pure denomination&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;figural metalanguage.&rdquo; And just as Rousseau creates the
fiction of a primitive man frightened by the sight of the other, de
Man gives us the fiction of an uncorrupted &ldquo;reader&rdquo; of
Rousseau plunged into civilized consternation by the incoherence and
self-contradiction he discovers in the very texture of language: &ldquo;as
soon as a text knows what it states, it can only act deceptively.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote10anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote10sym"><SUP>10</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
Here is the alleged rot, the source of the postmodern distaste. But
this conclusion is drawn from an analysis, de Man concedes, whose
&ldquo;intricacy &hellip; is obviously tied to the choice of the
example.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote11anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote11sym"><SUP>11</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
For Rousseau&rsquo;s commentator that choice is justified by the
claim that language is &ldquo;about language and not about things,&rdquo;
a claim qualified by the caveat that this is true only &ldquo;<I>to
the extent that</I> <I>all language is conceptual.</I>&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote12anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote12sym"><SUP>12</SUP></A></FONT></SUP></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">To what extent is that?<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote13anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote13sym"><SUP>13</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
To what extent can it be said that the Enlightenment took all
language to be conceptual language? In order to begin to answer this
question, let us set against the passage from Rousseau that de Man so
brilliantly analyzes a passage from another roughly contemporary
Enlightenment text, Diderot&rsquo;s celebrated discussion of the
blind man of Le Puiseaux in the<I> Lettre sur les aveugles</I>. What,
Diderot asks, does this man, blind from birth, understand by the word
<I>mirror</I>? And his answer is that &ldquo;a mirror is a machine
which sets things in relief at a distance from themselves if they
happen to be suitably placed in relation to it.&rdquo;</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Diderot&rsquo;s choice
of a case to study is as noteworthy as Rousseau&rsquo;s choice of an
example. In a sense, Diderot&rsquo;s blind man is the antithesis of
Rousseau&rsquo;s savage. The idea of putting sensualist metaphysics
to the test by studying the perception of the blind was of course a
commonplace of the time. Concerning this point, William Molyneux had
posed a crucial question to John Locke,<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote14anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote14sym"><SUP>14</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
and Pierre Coste&rsquo;s translation of Locke&rsquo;s <I>Essay</I>
had made Molyneux&rsquo;s question famous across the Continent.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote15anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote15sym"><SUP>15</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
Any number of <I>philosophes</I> had pondered the matter. But
Diderot, as his editor notes, parted company with the others in at
least one important respect: where they saw &ldquo;an abstract
problem of justifying a philosophy, Diderot saw a human problem: the
blind man lives in a distinctive world, and if we are to make contact
with him we must bring to the task great patience, clever questions,
and&mdash;something no one else had thought of&mdash;an elite subject
&hellip; a <I>blind philosopher</I>.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote16anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote16sym"><SUP>16</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
Not an inarticulate savage, then, lacking even the most basic
concepts of comparison, but a blind philosopher.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Diderot questions this
philosopher in a way that suggests that he, like de Man, believes
that the moment singled out by Rousseau, of self-confrontation
mediated by confrontation with the other, is one worth exploring in
some detail. How does he go about this? He asks the blind man what he
understands by the word &ldquo;mirror.&rdquo; Now, this is indeed a
&ldquo;clever question,&rdquo; for what is a mirror? To the sighted,
it is an instrument with the uncanny ability to make visible that
which ordinarily one cannot see: one&rsquo;s own face. To the other
my face is my distinguishing feature, the mark of my identity. In my
face he reads who I am. In a world without mirrors a crucial aspect
of my identity would thus remain forever beyond my ken, a part of the
world that <I>is</I> but not of the world I <I>know</I>. The mirror
fills in what would otherwise remain a gaping blank in my identity
papers. It brings me face-to-face with myself <I>as</I> other. But
only if I can see.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Now, when Diderot asks
the blind philosopher what he understands by &ldquo;mirror,&rdquo;
the man responds that it is &ldquo;a machine which sets things in
relief at a distance from themselves.&rdquo; Diderot&rsquo;s
interpretation of this response is an interesting foray into
linguistic analysis. He wants to explain how the blind man can employ
a term like &ldquo;mirror&rdquo; to which he can attach no perceptual
image, or idea (as the eighteenth century used that word): &ldquo;If
he attaches no ideas to the terms he uses, he at least has the
advantage over most people that he never misuses those terms.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote17anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote17sym"><SUP>17</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
According to Diderot, three things combine to make such pitch-perfect
usage possible. First, the blind man brings his own distinctive
experience to bear: he &ldquo;knows objects only through the sense of
touch.&rdquo; Furthermore, he knows from the reports of others that
the sighted can identify objects at a distance, on sight. Yet they
cannot, he has also been told, see their own faces except in a
mirror. Combining these notions, part empirical, part hearsay, he
deduces that the sighted use the word &ldquo;mirror&rdquo; to
describe an instrument that allows them to employ the sense of sight,
which for them is the primary means of apprehending the world, in
order to apprehend what ordinarily they cannot, namely, the viewer&rsquo;s
own face. But since the blind man understands &ldquo;apprehending&rdquo;
only in tactile terms, this instrument must somehow &ldquo;set
objects in relief at a distance from themselves.&rdquo; Hence his
answer to Diderot&rsquo;s question.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote18anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote18sym"><SUP>18</SUP></A></FONT></SUP></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Now, we may, since the
hologram had not been invented at the time, assume that this
relief-generating copy machine is a name without a referent. In this
respect the blind philosopher&rsquo;s machine resembles Rousseau&rsquo;s
&ldquo;giant,&rdquo; for there were no literal giants in the
primitive forest, only other hominids magnified into giants by fear.
Both &ldquo;giant&rdquo; in the mouth of the fearful savage and
&ldquo;mirror&rdquo; in the mouth of the blind <I>philosophe</I> are,
to use de Man&rsquo;s term, &ldquo;wild&rdquo; metaphors, &ldquo;to
some degree aberrant.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote19anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote19sym"><SUP>19</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
What separates de Man&rsquo;s Rousseau from Diderot&rsquo;s
philosopher is what happens next, or, rather, what has already
happened that makes what happens next plausible, not to say
inevitable. For according to de Man, &ldquo;conceptualization is a
double process.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote20anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote20sym"><SUP>20</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
Earlier he indicated that in the &ldquo;encounter with other men, the
first reaction of the primitive is said to be fear.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote21anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote21sym"><SUP>21</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
This fearful reaction &ldquo;is certainly not obvious,&rdquo; the
critic tells us. But half a page later we read that Rousseau&rsquo;s
choice of fear of the other as his primary example in the genesis of
conceptual terms &ldquo;enriches the pattern to a considerable
degree.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote22anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote22sym"><SUP>22</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
With this benediction paranoia is enshrined at the very heart of
language. Conceptual thought is presented as a defense mechanism, a
secondary elaboration erected upon a primal instinct, fear, in order
to fix, or in de Man&rsquo;s word, &ldquo;tame,&rdquo; energy that
would otherwise remain &ldquo;wild&rdquo; and &ldquo;aberrant.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote23anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote23sym"><SUP>23</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">The blind philosopher&rsquo;s
aberration is quite different in nature. For him, too,
&ldquo;conceptualization is a double process.&rdquo; For de Man,
however, the conceptual term is the end product of this process,
whereas for Diderot it is the beginning. For the blind philosopher,
the word &ldquo;mirror&rdquo; <I>precedes</I> the explanatory
discourse which produces, in response to a question, a justification
of its use. Furthermore, that explanatory discourse is constructed
out of reports elicited from sighted speakers about their usage of
the term, together with inferences drawn from the blind speaker&rsquo;s
own experience. Language, far from being &ldquo;always already&rdquo;
about language, is &ldquo;always already&rdquo; embedded in <I>social
forms</I>. Without sociability it would have no reason to exist.
Meaning is use, and because he is a social being, capable of
adjusting his behavior in light of the responses and expectations of
others, the blind philosopher can use the word mirror appropriately
without ever having seen a mirror. By combining experience with
attentiveness to the reports of others, he has learned the rules, as
Wittgenstein would say, of the language-game of the sighted
community. Privately, however, he has contrived&mdash;in lieu, one
might say, of a perceptual correlate, of an &ldquo;idea&rdquo; of the
mirror&mdash;an explanation of those rules based upon his own quite
different experience; this explanation, which takes palpation to be
the pre-eminent mode of perception, is, we would say, aberrant. But
it is also secondary. It survives because it is not incompatible with
correct usage of the associated general term. It is not intrinsic to
language but a mere epiphenomenon. Its associated aberrations are
amenable to correction through sociable conversation. Diderot might
have elicited further understanding of the blind man&rsquo;s
linguistic universe by attempting to disabuse him of the notion that
a mirror functions by setting objects in relief at a distance from
themselves. Although he does not do this, he does explore the man&rsquo;s
understanding of other optical instruments (telescopes, microscopes,
etc.), and from this we see even more clearly how meaning is bound up
with &ldquo;forms of life.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote24anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote24sym"><SUP>24</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
We see this, for instance, in the blind philosophe&rsquo;s questions
to Diderot about optical instruments whose function he understands
but whose physical form cannot be deduced from that function. Is the
microscope, which makes small things large, smaller than the
telescope, which makes large things small? In the blind man&rsquo;s
life world, the sense of touch is primary, hence the heft of material
things is a matter of keen interest to him. He therefore puts first
questions that would not occur to a person who had learned the use of
the word telescope by <I>seeing</I> a telescope in use.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote25anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote25sym"><SUP>25</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
For him, it is plausible to think that the attribute &ldquo;enlarges&rdquo;
might bear a causal relation to the thing possessing that attribute:
the microscope&rsquo;s power to enlarge might in some way be related
to its size. Language thus has a generative power: questions grow out
of the nature of words by parthenogenesis, as it were, without the
impregnation of perception.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Thus the blind man can
use the noun &rdquo;mirror&rdquo; as a &ldquo;name&rdquo; for a
&ldquo;concept,&rdquo; but the act of naming does not exhaust the
meaning of the term, does not, as Foucault would have it, &ldquo;name
its being.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote26anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote26sym"><SUP>26</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
His engagement in society, his use of language not as a simple mirror
of reality but as a compass with which to orient himself and find his
way among his fellow men, exemplifies a power of <I>poiesis</I> that
postmodernism wrongly asserts the Enlightenment suppressed in favor
of more disciplined and circumspect <I>mimesis</I>.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Here, then, we have two
models of the operation of language and, more specifically, of
conceptual terms within language. For de Man, language functions as a
repressive institution: it is a means by which an individual subject
imposes sameness (&ldquo;man&rdquo; as universal) in order to repress
the memory of an aberrant passion (fear of the other as putatively
different). For Diderot, on the other hand, language is a social
institution: it is a means by which two or more individuals whose
experience differs (the blind and the sighted, say) can communicate
about matters of mutual interest, correct misperceptions and
misinterpretations, and develop an intuitive grasp of the implicit
rules that permit them to coexist in harmony.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Each of these models
leaves something out, however. What is left out of de Man&rsquo;s
account of Rousseau&rsquo;s thinking is an explanation of how a
conceptual term generated by an intrasubjective psychological process
becomes intelligible to other individuals: how, in other words, does
the universal term &ldquo;man&rdquo; become part of a public and not
simply a private language? And what is left out of Diderot&rsquo;s
account is how a general term like &ldquo;mirror,&rdquo; which the
sighted community shares with the blind, comes into being in the
first place. De Man&rsquo;s account of language is thus genetic but
lacks a social component, whereas Diderot&rsquo;s is descriptive and
functional but lacks a genetic component.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">It might be objected
that de Man implicitly offers a psychoanalytic in lieu of a social
component. It is as if language for de Man, like civilization for
Freud, were an edifice built out of a multitude of repressions, with
concomitant discontents. We can converse because the speaking self in
each of us stands where the inarticulate id used to be. Whatever
plausibility such an argument for bridging the gap between individual
and collective experience may have in psychoanalysis, however, it
seems less applicable to language, whose primary processes are more
varied than those of psychic development. Unless, as de Man seems at
times to suggest, fear is the universal experience. Why else single
out an episode of fear as the essence of Rousseau&rsquo;s philosophy
of language, when that philosophy is, as we shall see, considerably
more eclectic than de Man&rsquo;s version would have us believe (that
is why I refer to de Man&rsquo;s version as de Man&rsquo;s, rather
than Rousseau&rsquo;s). Perhaps fear seemed to de Man, who lived in
an age distinguished by darkness rather than Enlightenment, <I>the</I>
universal experience.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">If the Enlightenment can
be said to have had a universal experience, surely it was one of
astonishment at the breaking down of barriers. Indeed, a central
metaphor seized upon by Daniel Roche to describe France in the
Enlightenment is that of <I>d&eacute;senclavement</I>.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><I>
<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote27anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote27sym"><SUP>27</SUP></A></I></FONT></SUP>
Social barriers fell as men and women of different estates and
conditions mingled in salons and academies. Geographic barriers were
overcome by improvements in roads, waterways, and means of
conveyance. And linguistic barriers were reduced if not eliminated by
translators such as Pierre Coste<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote28anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote28sym"><SUP>28</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
and Denis Diderot, to whom I shall return in a moment. But first
consider the psychic consequences of such <I>d&eacute;senclavement</I>.
When barriers fell, man confronted his other, just as he had in the
primal forest of Rousseau&rsquo;s imagination. Was his first reaction
one of fear, as Rousseau would have it in the <I>Essai</I>, or one of
triumph, curiosity, wonder, admiration, interest, and sometimes envy?</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">On Rousseau&rsquo;s own
account it could be both. In the Turin dinner scene described in Book
3 of <I>Les Confessions</I> and admirably analyzed by Jean
Starobinski,<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote29anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote29sym"><SUP>29</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
Jean-Jacques goes from &ldquo;a state of separation and anxiety&rdquo;
caused by &ldquo;the pain of distance (whether social or amorous)&rdquo;
to a &ldquo;jubilant moment of triumph&rdquo; after he successfully
explains the meaning of an obscure word in the motto of an
aristocratic family. But &ldquo;he is then plunged back into
separation and aridity,&rdquo; though &ldquo;not without the
bittersweet pleasures of memory and hope.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote30anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote30sym"><SUP>30</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
Here, Rousseau has transposed the encounter with the savage into an
eighteenth-century salon. At the first sight of the Other, magnified
to gigantic proportions by social superiority, Jean-Jacques suffers
&ldquo;anxiety&rdquo; and the &ldquo;pain of distance.&rdquo; Then,
however, his linguistic mastery smashes the social barrier, winning a
brief but jubilant triumph. Only then does the quintessential Other,
Mademoiselle de Breil, the object of Rousseau&rsquo;s desire, become
sufficiently his Like to make plausible the transmogrification of
desire into love. Language becomes an instrument of conquest, and
preeminently of sexual conquest. Indeed, the obscure word that
Jean-Jacques explains to his amazed betters is <I>fiert</I>, which
they, to whom French is a foreign tongue, mistake for a corrupt
spelling of <I>fier</I>, proud, but which he contends is a corruption
of the old French <I>ferit</I>, &ldquo;he strikes, he wounds,&rdquo;
so that the family motto, on his reading, becomes &ldquo;some strike
and do not kill.&rdquo; For Rousseau, this scene is a paradigm of
linguistic conquest: language is <I>par excellence</I> the instrument
by which the man of hidden genius strikes the world, leaves his mark
upon it, and thereby stakes his claim to the otherwise inaccessible
Woman. Language, which for Rousseau is a private treasure, a psychic
hoard, is momentarily exchanged for the social currency that
establishes the speaker&rsquo;s rightful place in the world.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Diderot is at once more
worldly and less miserly. For him, the linguistic gift is what common
sense was for Descartes, the thing most widely shared in the world.
He displays an unrivaled capacity for amazement at the genius of
others. Thus he says of the blind man of Le Puiseaux that his
explanation of the phenomena of sight is no less clear and therefore
all the more wonderful than that of Descartes&rsquo; <I>Dioptrique</I>.
And just as he is keen to explore the meaning of sight by engaging a
blind man in conversation, he is eager to explore the meaning of
society by conversing with an outsider, Rameau&rsquo;s bohemian
nephew.  Not as eager as some, who make of bohemians like the nephew
&ldquo;their familiar acquaintances, even their friends,&rdquo; but
still eager enough because the outsider is the &ldquo;grain of
leavening &hellip; that restores a portion of each person&rsquo;s
natural individuality &hellip; brings the truth, reveals the good
people, unmasks the scoundrels. And so the man of good sense listens,
and unravels his world.&rdquo; Conversation with the outsider has
this power because Rameau&rsquo;s nephew is the socialized man&rsquo;s
other, who has thrown off &ldquo;the tedious uniformity that our
education, our social conventions, and our customary proprieties have
introduced.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote31anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote31sym"><SUP>31</SUP></A></FONT></SUP></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">&ldquo;Tedious
uniformity&rdquo;: if Rousseau&rsquo;s savage evolved the concept
&ldquo;man&rdquo; to fix and stabilize the gnawing anxieties stemming
from his fear of <I>the other</I>, Diderot&rsquo;s <I>moi</I> enages
in conversation with Rameau&rsquo;s bohemian nephew because he fears
<I>the same</I>. <I>D&eacute;senclavement</I> introduced a
disorienting uniformity into the world: &ldquo;It is almost
impossible to distinguish people by their exterior. The shopkeeper
dresses like a gentleman. &hellip; <I>Adieu la diff&eacute;rence</I>.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote32anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote32sym"><SUP>32</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
Equality has its discontents. While it may procure relief from terror
of the other&rsquo;s greater power or strength or wealth or talent,
the social rapprochement that equality permits frustrates the
expression of the individual&rsquo;s enabling sense of difference:
&ldquo;One is vain, scornful, and consequently unjust whenever one
can be so with impunity,&rdquo; writes Helv&eacute;tius. &ldquo;Who
does not believe himself to be the best person of his society, and
who does not catch himself now and then pretending that he is the
foremost person in the world? &hellip; Who does not desire public
confirmation of the high opinion he has of himself?&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote33anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote33sym"><SUP>33</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
Baffled in this quest for difference, the self may feel trapped,
caught in a fatal web of determinations: &ldquo;Can I not be me?&rdquo;
asks Jacques le Fataliste. &ldquo;And, being me, can I do other than
I do?&rdquo; Nothing less than liberty is at stake. The language that
can speak only equality, the language that lacks the style to
accommodate, express, or conjure with difference, is, for Rousseau,
the language of animals, the grunt of natural need: &ldquo;The
animals that speak [these &ldquo;natural&rdquo; languages] have them
from birth &hellip; and everywhere [they are] the same; they do not
change, they make no progress whatsoever.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote34anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote34sym"><SUP>34</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
Human language, the language of change, hence of liberty and
progress, must therefore not only express difference, it must create
it; it must be not just conceptual language &ldquo;constative&rdquo;
of difference but a &ldquo;performative&rdquo; instrument, a carillon
of the self.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote35anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote35sym"><SUP>35</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
&ldquo;Style,&rdquo; Buffon said contemporaneously, &ldquo;is the
very man.&rdquo; And that creature of style, Rameau&rsquo;s nephew,
offers an apt metaphor for the relation between self and language
when he speaks of the relation between melody and words in opera:
&ldquo;The words must be thought of as one line and the melody as
another which snakes around it.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote36anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote36sym"><SUP>36</SUP></A></FONT></SUP></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">What is distinctively
human about language, then, is not just the capacity to ascribe
universal denominations to concepts but the ability to project the
movement, the passions, the velleities of the self that each
speaker&rsquo;s unique utterances enfold. Language is not always
conceptual language, which substitutes sameness for difference.
Language&mdash;<I>parole</I> as opposed to <I>langue</I>&mdash;is
also voice, style, the art of variegating sameness.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">How is such an art
learned? Again we have divergent answers, depending on whether one
would shun society or seek it. For Helv&eacute;tius, the art of
language is not so much learned as imbibed in &ldquo;silence and
solitude. If the muses, as the poets tell us, are fond of woods,
meadows, and fountains, it is because one savors there a tranquillity
that shuns the city, and when a person, detached from the petty
interests of society, there reflects upon himself, he will reflect
upon man in general, and his thoughts will belong to, and please, all
mankind.&rdquo; Sociability, in other words, is the enemy of
universality. For sociability depends on reciprocal esteem, and the
thinker who seeks the esteem of any <I>soci&eacute;t&eacute;
particuli&egrave;re</I> is obscurely aware that such esteem would
prove only &ldquo;the similarity of his ideas&rdquo; to those of
others. Universality is the reward of the thinker prepared to subject
himself to the rigors of isolation, just as &ldquo;the pride of
giving orders to kings compensated the Romans for the harshness of
their military discipline.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote37anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote37sym"><SUP>37</SUP></A></FONT></SUP></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Diderot, however, offers
another answer: imitate&mdash;not nature but others who possess
qualities of style that one envies and would like to emulate. Culture
is not, or at any rate not only, the work of isolated culture heroes;
it is (also) a commerce in which comparative advantages are sometimes
to be found in one place or another. Rameau&rsquo;s nephew recommends
that the French pay heed to the Italians so as to experience &ldquo;with
what facility, suppleness, and suavity the harmony, prosody, and
ellipses of the Italian tongue lend themselves to the art, movement,
expression, and turns of melody and the measured value of sound.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote38anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote38sym"><SUP>38</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
Of course they would even then &ldquo;continue to ignore how stiff,
dull, clumsy, cumbersome, pedantic, and monotonous&rdquo; their own
language is, for such is human nature, but eventually &ldquo;my
trinity &hellip; the true, the good, and the beautiful&rdquo; will
prevail, for art, the play of difference, offers relief from the
&ldquo;tedious uniformity&rdquo; of philosophy. Now, this rhetorical
gesture of the nephew&rsquo;s is in one sense merely a
nationalization of the quarrel of the ancients and the moderns: for
just as it had been possible in the sixteenth century to wonder
whether the French or the Italian language lacked the resources for
great poetry so manifestly abundant in Latin and Greek, so, too, was
it possible, <I>mutatis mutandis</I>, to extol the one modern tongue
over the other by adducing the same alleged qualities of vigor,
vivacity, and sinew.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote39anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote39sym"><SUP>39</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
This was the natural rhetoric, the intrinsic symptomatology, of the
anxiety of influence.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">If nations felt that
anxiety, so, too, and no less acutely, did individuals. It was the
inevitable counterpart of <I>d&eacute;senclavement</I>. The fallen
barriers had been landmarks as well as walls. One response was
withdrawal to the &ldquo;woods, meadows, and fountains&rdquo; of
which Helv&eacute;tius speaks: &ldquo;se cacher pour mieux se
montrer,&rdquo; as Rousseau put it. Another was to venture forth in
borrowed robes. Diderot, still a youth unsure of his voice, chose
this course when he translated Shaftesbury&rsquo;s <I>Essay &hellip;</I>.
Of course &ldquo;translation&rdquo; is not a strictly accurate
description of Diderot&rsquo;s appropriation of Shaftesbury&rsquo;s
text. He interpolated passages of his own. Daniel Gordon has pointed
to one of these in particular, which interests the historian of
sociability because of the analogy it draws between social feeling
and worshipful reverence: &ldquo;Avoir les affections sociales
enti&egrave;res &hellip; c&rsquo;est imiter, c&rsquo;est repr&eacute;senter
l&rsquo;Etre supr&ecirc;me sous une forme humaine.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote40anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote40sym"><SUP>40</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
There is an admirable force to the paratactic structure of this
passage (a parataxis not present, incidentally, in Shaftesbury):
<I>c&rsquo;est &hellip;, c&rsquo;est &hellip;. </I>(one is reminded
of Montaigne&rsquo;s <I>parce que c&rsquo;&eacute;tait lui, parce que
c&rsquo;&eacute;tait moi</I>, the classic expression of the
ineffability of &ldquo;social affections&rdquo;). To feel unalloyed
affection for one&rsquo;s not unalloyed fellow man, for man, that is,
not in the abstract but in the concrete otherness of his social
existence, may well require nothing less than <I>imitatio dei</I>, or
emulation of divine forbearance. Or, taking the other clause of the
parataxis, to feel unalloyed social affection is &ldquo;to represent
the Supreme Being in human form,&rdquo; that is, to exhibit in a mode
accessible to human understanding an invisible, inaccessible form of
affection, divine love (Diderot was, at the time he made this
translation, still a theist). So much for the metaphoric reading of
the passage; but there is also a metonymic reading: Diderot as
translator is both <I>imitating</I> Shaftesbury (his voice, his
aristocratic ease, which Diderot the bourgeois writer eagerly
coveted) and <I>representing</I> him (as an emissary carrying his
ideas about social affection across the chasm separating Protestant,
commercial, constitutional Britain from Catholic, mercantilist,
absolutist France). If civilization was a source of anxiety, perhaps
it was because it had to be smuggled across borders as contraband.
Translators were smugglers of the new. If language in one of its
modes was for the Enlightenment an instrument for variegating
sameness, so was translation at its highest pitch. The eighteenth
century anticipated Walter Benjamin&rsquo;s advice that the
translator must allow &ldquo;his language to be powerfully affected
by the foreign language.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote41anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote41sym"><SUP>41</SUP></A></FONT></SUP></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">It would be a mistake,
however, to think that all variety came from abroad. The eighteenth
century was a time of exuberant technical progress, and Diderot was
among the first to recognize what an impoverishment of language would
result if working men were banished from the <I>beaux quartiers</I>:
&ldquo;What diversity is introduced into language every day by the
arts, machines, and manual skills (<I>manoeuvres</I>).&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote42anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote42sym"><SUP>42</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
The <I>Encyclop&eacute;die </I>was conceived in part as a compendium
of these specialized tongues, a compendium that would be not just a
passive record of the jargons of the trades but an artful selection
designed with a political goal in mind, namely, to further progress
by initiating a conversation&mdash;for it is &ldquo;through the
inveterate habit of conversing among themselves that working men
understand one another, and far more by repeatedly facing the same
situations (<I>par le retour des conjonctures</I>) than by relying on
any fixed terminology&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote43anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote43sym"><SUP>43</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>&mdash;and
thus making the trades mutually intelligible, thereby &ldquo;eliminating
the traditional barriers between guilds.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote44anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote44sym"><SUP>44</SUP></A></FONT></SUP></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Traditionally in France
the institutions of the monarchy had made language a matter of
distinction. The best French was that spoken by the <I>sanior pars</I>
of French society, the court. Eloquence was a matter of <I>police</I>,
meaning at once polish and discipline. The Acad&eacute;mie served,
its historian reminds us, both to civilize and to enforce.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote45anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote45sym"><SUP>45</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
It was a sort of hothouse of the tongue, and as with all hothouse
plants there was a danger of etiolation in unnatural and isolated
profusion: &ldquo;Words have multiplied endlessly, and knowledge of
things has fallen behind.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote46anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote46sym"><SUP>46</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
The language had been drained of its substance, in other words, and
Diderot aimed to reinvigorate it by embracing rather than shunning
those who remained in contact with things, whose knowledge of the
world, like the blind man&rsquo;s, was tactile and direct. Yet even
an ecumenical undertaking like the <I>Encyclopedia</I>&mdash;ecumenical
in the root sense, meaning about the &ldquo;world which we
inhabit&rdquo;&mdash;could not be so utopian as to dispense
altogether with <I>police</I>: there are too many words in the world,
too many specialized words intelligible only within particular
milieus&mdash;so that an editor must be careful not so much &ldquo;to
introduce new terms as to banish [superfluous] synonyms.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote47anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote47sym"><SUP>47</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
Again, a balance is to be struck between fearful exclusion of the
other and the &ldquo;tedious sameness&rdquo; of indiscriminate
reduction to equality.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">Diderot leaves no doubt
about where disruption of the necessary balance between sameness and
difference, equality and distinction, may lead. &ldquo;People will
spit on a petty thief,&rdquo; he has the nephew say, &ldquo;but they
cannot withhold a kind of respect from a great criminal.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote48anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote48sym"><SUP>48</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
He has, moreover, a precise notion of the kind of crime to which the
avidity of distinction bred by tedious sameness will give rise: the
&ldquo;renegade of Avignon&rdquo; is a man capable of befriending a
Jew and then denouncing him to authorities committed to the
extirpation of difference in the name of purity of the faith. The
Jew, rendered different from his fellow man by a slanderous speech
act, dies in the holocaust of the Inquisition, and the renegade
seizes his fortune. The criminal&rsquo;s depravity of character has
already revealed itself in the mirror of language, however: &ldquo;Can
a vicious person speak in an even tone?&rdquo; the nephew asks.
Language keeps no secrets.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">#</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">It will be clear by now
that to describe the language of Enlightenment as &ldquo;a
substitution of sameness for difference&rdquo; is to create a
self-describing artifact, a text which, as de Man alleged, &ldquo;acts
deceptively&rdquo; because it &ldquo;knows what it states.&rdquo; Yet
it cannot be denied that this deception has enjoyed a considerable
measure of success. That success requires explanation. It is a fact
verified daily in college literature courses that rhetorical modes
lose their effectiveness. Words that once stirred the soul or brought
tears to the eyes elicit only snickers: Rousseau&rsquo;s <I>Julie</I>
is a case in point. Rousseau would have been surprised, for he
believed that the qualities of language were essential rather than
historical and contingent: &ldquo;There are languages favorable to
freedom,&rdquo; he wrote in the <I>Essai</I>. &ldquo;They are
sonorous, rhythmic, harmonious &hellip; Ours are made for the buzz of
the couch.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote49anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote49sym"><SUP>49</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
In order to change the quality of the language one spoke, it was
necessary to change the person one was, to accept that harsh Roman
discipline to which Helv&eacute;tius alluded. This Rousseau saw
himself as having accomplished, and it would have astonished him to
discover that the virile language of liberty he believed he had
forged had become fit only for the buzz not of the couch but of the
seminar room.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">What might have helped
him to explain the fate of his style was what he of course could not
know, his place, as it were, in history. His savage among giants was
like Hobbes&rsquo; man among wolves, the taming of whose aberrant
energies required an absolute monarch whose fate it was to be
beheaded by Rousseau&rsquo;s &ldquo;man.&rdquo; Rousseau could not
have known this because his understanding of the sovereignty of the
general will was like the blind philosopher&rsquo;s understanding of
the mirror, synthetic <I>a priori</I>, perfect for articulating a
political discourse in conformity with the rules governing the
language-game of an age that had never yet seen a republic of free
and equal citizens.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.76cm">This particular mirror
we can now perceive with the clarity of hindsight, and the image it
reflects fills us with the usual ambivalence of self-recognition. The
blind philosopher&rsquo;s description disturbs us because it reminds
us of how beautiful we thought we might be before belated sobriety
dimmed our bright fancies. Yet if we can now see the mirror, we still
see ourselves only as we were, never as we are. To the present we
remain blind. Perhaps the point of Diderot&rsquo;s parable is that we
should not expect, ever, to see ourselves as we are: those who think
they <I>can</I> see should listen to the blind and converse with
those who work with their hands in order to find out what they are
missing. Clairvoyance is not ours. What we do have, all we have, is
the ability to discuss what a mirror would have to be like in order
to reflect an image of such creatures as we take ourselves to be. Man
in the mirror of language is thus what Jameson calls a simulacrum, &ldquo;a
copy for which no original has ever existed.&rdquo;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote50anc" HREF="enlightenment.html#sdfootnote50sym"><SUP>50</SUP></A></FONT></SUP>
If a fascination with simulacra is the hallmark of the postmodern,
then the postmodern begins with Diderot.</P>

	One sees this Austinian distinction applied to the nominative &ldquo;man&rdquo;
	in Shakespeare&rsquo;s <I>Macbeth</I>, when Macduff, adjured to
	&ldquo;dispute like a man&rdquo; the murder of his wife and
	children, replies &ldquo;I shall do so, but I must also feel it as a
	man.&rdquo; In so enunciating the difference between action and
	pathos, his pain becomes as real for others as it already is for
	himself. Here the distinguishing passion, though subsumed as in
	Rousseau&rsquo;s example within the universal substantive, is not
	effaced: Macduff is both a man who avenges a wrong (and he who does
	not avenge a wrong is not a man), but he is also a man capable of
	making the pain of that wrong visible to others: both justice and
	eloquence speak in his behalf.</P>
